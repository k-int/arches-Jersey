One group of three incised lines decorate one edge of the bezel, whilst pairs of two incised lines make up three of the decorative divisions. The centre of the ring bears only one incised line, that continues for a short portion of the hoop on each side.   At each top edge of the bezel, above the first dividing lines and within each foil, are hand-stamped sun-shapes. One sun shape sits within each foil, totalling three on each edge. The next division on each edge bears more sun shapes from the same stamp, organised irregularly, and follow the curving of the incised lines. One division bears eight sun-shapes and the other bears nine. The centre of the bezel, at each side of the single dividing incised lines, is marked by irregularly stamped cross or ""x-shapes"", one side with seven and one side with eight.

016acef1-cb6f-4621-9794-3847aa678346,0200238,Figurine,Certain,"Incomplete cast bronze figurine of Iron Age date, with upper half and legs found separately. This object is identified and discussed in Martin Henig and Mark Wood (1990), who describe the object as following:""The upper part of a cast bronze of a nude male figure (Plate l), which X-ray fluorescence analysis has shown to have been made of a leaded tin bronze alloy. It is covered with a green patination, and has suffered more seriously from corrosion in places. The figure is broken away at the waist, immediately below the navel, the shallow boring of which may have provided a point of weakness. The body is of slight build and reasonably well modelled at least on the front, but the back is rough. The right arm is bent at the elbow but as the hand is missing there is no indication of any attribute. The navel and nipples are indicated by shallow borings (the nipple on the left of the body having been lost through corrosion). In relation to the body, the pear-shaped head is massive. It is turned to the left (i.e. the viewer’s right). The physiognomy is dominated by large eyes with heavy brows, the pupil of the right eye is bored and the slit mouth is emphasised by heavy lips. As far as can be seen, the nose is flat and triangular, but wear and corrosion have made detail indistinct. Ears are barely indicated by depressions at the sides of the head. The crown is flattened and slopes backwards. The surface here is badly corroded. Dimensions: Surviving height 38 mm; greatest width 28 mm; depth of body 6 mm; depth of head (from the chin to the crown of the head) 12 mm. While the tradition of naturalistic bronzecasting is a Mediterranean one, which only becomes widespread in north-westem Europe with the coming of the Roman Empire, this bronze is in no way related to Roman bronzes of the Imperial period, although it is not unlike some clearly native figurines made in the North of Italy from the fourth to the second century BC (Franzoni 1980, 121-158, nos 100-137). It seems that these were imported across the Alps and up the RhBne valley and copied in Gaul (Boucher 1976, 13-43); especially close is the figure from Pointe du Raz in Western Brittany (ibid. 35, fig. 35). The prototype was probably an Italic Hercules (Franzoni, op. cit.), but it is not known what such a bronze might have symbolised in Gaul. It is worth mentioning that early bronzes are known from Britain. Actual Italic bronzes are recorded from Mount Batten, Plymouth (Cunliffe 1988, 70-72, nos 128, 129). Two very fine female figurines of Iron Age date come from Aust-by-Severn (Cunliffe 1978, 155, and plate 22b, but not Iberian as stated); and from Henley Wood (Wilson 1970,296 and plate XXXVd) . Male figures are recorded from Dartmoor (Christie’s Antiquities Sale Catalogue, 16 December 1982,8, lot 24), and from Maiden Castle (in the Dorset County Museum, Dorchester) . All of these bronzes are from sites in south-western Britain."". Post-publication, the legs of this figurine were found, and the figurine now resides in the Jersey Heritage collection.References: Henig, M. and Wood, M.

The knapped flint was used within the musket hammer mechanism to produce a spark and could last between 20-25 shots before it had to be replaced. They were produced from shaped long blanks (see KENT-AA1B15) and then snapped off sometimes on as and when basis.A similar example has been recorded as WILT-0B6F58 which states that ""there is no documentary evidence for when or where sparks from flint were first used to fire gunpowder, but flintlock guns were being used in France from about 1600.

Above the heart is a crown with a central complete fleur-de-lis flanked by a half fleur-de-lis on each side. Either side of the bezel on the outer surface of the band is moulded decoration. Immediately flanking the bezel on each side are curved vinescroll decoration, the gaps filled with small round pellets.

79a64152-8f40-4553-877a-651d71638d28,0401592,Axehead,Certain,"Cast copper alloy complete flanged axehead (Haches à rebords) of 'Medoc' type II (type Médocain), or Atlantic type with Medoc influence, dating from the transitional Early to Middle Bronze Age (Briard and Verron 1976; Coffyn and Mohen 1968; Roussot-Larroque 1968).The axe begins at a flat, rectangular butt 24.07mm in width, gently flaring out for its entire length before diverging more strongly to produce a slight crescent-shaped cutting edge at a width of 59.03mm. Flanges emerge from the butt of the axe on each face, running almost its entire length save for the cutting edge itself. These flanges measure at a depth of c.10.04mm and c.6.42mm at the thickest point. The butt is uneven and flared, though flat, showing evidence of extensive hammering to its rear. the cutting edge of the blade is still very sharp and complete, except for two chips. Evidence of hammering and sharpening is visible at its edge.The axe is roughly lozenge shaped in profile, with faint but visible casting seams on each side, which appear to have been carefully filed. The axe is undecorated.The surface of the object is slightly abraded and almost entirely unpatinated due to its intertidal findspot, save for some recessed areas. The object is otherwise in very good condition, with clear unrolled edges, and likely sat on a deep surface layer below the sand. The axe most closely resembles those of Medoc type II (or 'medium type'), named after those found in Médoc in Southern France. This type is exemplified by its length, measuring from 140 to 160mm, and flange depth measuring 8mm to 11mm. The axehead does bear some similarity to Atlantic type axeheads, with its flaring cutting edge, but is significantly larger than axes of this type. Briard and Verron (1976, pp.51-52) highlight overlap between Medoc type axes and other forms, such as Atlantic types. This axe may represent some Medoc-Atlantic cross influence.Notes:Though the findspot of the axe was intertidal, it is found squarely in-line with the course of a valley and stream. The land and stream may have continued over the ancient land-surface of the time, and imply a purposeful deposition within a stream or its mouth, a common feature for Bronze Age Finds. References:Briard, J. and Verron, G. 1976.

Encircling the legend are two pelleted borders before the edge of the object. The rear of the object is flat and bears two remaining loops, though the pin is now missing. The pin construction style consists of one C-shaped loop, and one C-shaped hook, corresponding with Weech type A form (Weech 2014, p.63).Disc brooches of this type are firmly Middle to Late Early Medieval in date, though exact dating is difficult without added archaeological context.

Surrounding the boss are three  concentric beaded circles, which are likely imitation filigree (Weech 2014). Within these circles are various forms of decoration. The decoration within first border surrounding the boss is heavily abraded, though some C-shaped scroll and pellet decoration survives. The second border contains small, diagonal transverse lines. The third border contains much larger interconnecting C-shaped scrolls.  The rear of the object is predominantly flat, with the area to the rear of the boss is slightly concave, though not perfectly so.

A possible bag or satchel hangs at her left back from her waist, though this may represent the fabric hanging loose from the left shoulder.The surface of the object bears the remains of gilding in recesses, a practice that is noted in other surviving Roman figurines (Duhrum 2012, 2.2.4).Though it would be expected that similar figurines be found in Gaul, no immediately similar figurines are illustrated in Boucher (1976). Instead, this object most closely resembles Roman figurines from the Southbroom Hoard in Southern England, which include similar transverse drapery from the shoulder to the waist (Duhrum 2014, pp.195-221, fig 4, a-b).The identities of Roman and Gallo-Roman figurines are difficult to discern with missing hands and feet, as many diagnostic features are related to objects held by the figure (Duhrum 2014, 2.3.1). The figurine may represent a deity or human. This figurine bears some resemblance to depiction of a maenad or bacchae, female followers of the god Dionysis or Bacchus. The bare breast with one raised arm can be seen in similar maenad depictions, where she may hold a thyrsus staff or snake. Alternatively, the Goddess Diana may be the intended identity of the figurine, who is commonly posed in an active stance with one hand reaching for an arrow at her back, and depicted with her hair in a bun. Revd. Professor Martin Henig, a specialist in Roman figurines, kindly comments that this figurine does appear Late Iron Age to Gallo-Roman in date.This object was found relatively close to other Iron Age and Gallo-Roman artefacts,c.0.5km from a Gallo-Roman terret ring (1200347), two Roman dupondii (1200347),  c. 1.45 from another Roman statuette (1200327), and other nearby Iron Age and Roman coins in this parish. This object was also discovered in a field directly beside a spring that feeds into a valley.References:Boucher, S.

The rabbet (triangular notch) is located at the apex of the head. The iron tongue is missing, though orange rust remains around the rabbet. The harp is irregular and cruder than previous examples recorded in Jersey (0600321, 1100393), possibly implying a relatively early date.Jew's (or jaw) harps have a long history of being folk instruments, with a wide geographical distributions. They are believed to be indigenous to South East Asia, and had been introduced to Europe by the Crusades (11th to 14th Centuries AD). The form of the European Jews harp, is made from metal, commonly iron in modern examples.Four iron jews harps were recovered from excavations in London's waterfront, and have been dated from c.1270 to c.1400 (Egan, 1998, 284-5). Over 150 examples have been recorded on the PAS database, most with a circular head as opposed to a flattened or oval head and the majority of them have been attributed to the Post Medieval period. This example is probably Late Medieval to Post Medieval in dating (1400 - 1700 AD).Reference:Egan, G. (1998), ""The Medieval Household Daily Living c. 1150 - c. 1450"".

b5c4d4b4-cc7f-4ffd-a5a3-4e961a445580,0800235,Figurine,Certain,"An incomplete and heavily worn cast lead statuette or figurine of Cupid in flight of probable Post-Medieval date (c.18-20th century) or possibly much earlier Gallo Roman date (c.AD 51-451).The figurine is missing the head and is formed naturalistically. The arms are incomplete, being broken before the elbows. The right arm is forward and upheld with the left arm backwards and pointing downwards. Each leg is missing before the knee, the left slightly lower than the right and standing further forward. The front of the torso bears the heavily abraded remains of a prominent draped garment which appears to meet at the abdomen. The garment is presented as two raised lines split by a groove that curve to the rear of the torso. Heavy abrasion and pitting makes further analysis difficult. The rear of the figurine has a broken area where wings were probably once attached. The object is covered with an intermittent white and brown patina.Three identical Cupid figurines cast of the same mould with surviving heads have been reported on the Portable Antiquity Scheme in Canterbury, Kent (KENT-BB54D0, KENT-223C9B, KENT-206D14). Dr. Emma Durham (2012) states that: ""Although a number of figurines are very similar, suggesting that they may have been made in the same workshop, there is almost no evidence for the reuse of moulds to produce figurines..."". Further, only 3.6% of Roman statuettes are cast in lead, with the vast majority (94.7%) cast in copper alloy (Duhram, 2012). Whilst the find matches a ""Cupid in Flight"" typing seen in Roman examples, only 1 of 32 Cupid figurines is depicted in a tunic, whilst all others are nude (Duhram 2012). These facts imply that the statuette is neo-classical in style and date, matching ornamental figurines produced in the 19th-20th century.References:Durham, E. 2012 Depicting the gods: metal figurines in Roman Britain, Internet Archaeology 31.","Length: 60.71mm, Width: 33.3mm, Thickness: 18.64mm, Weight: 69.1g.",Cast,Lead,St. Mary,Gallo-Roman 51 BCE-451 CE,Post Medieval 1540-1901 CE,25/11/2021,Cultivated land,Metal detector,Incomplete,Returned to Finder

The pin of the object still survives. The face of the brooch is uneven, varying from flat to convex, with a strong bevel on its inner side and a slight bevel on its outer edge. The object is decorated on three sides of its face with hand-stamped decoration, consisting of lines of five uneven and rough lozenge-shapes with concave sides (resembling a four-pointed star). These three decorated sides are each opposite undecorated sides. One side of the frame bears a clear cast recess to hold the pin, which is still in place. The copper-alloy pin is cast and bent around the pin-recess, and is curved in a bow-like fashion, possibly as a result of stress from use. The rear of the object is flat, with transverse tool marks clearly surviving from its manufacture. It is slightly pitted with corrosion and wear. The entire frame of the buckle is covered in a black coating or forced surface patina - a common way of finishing copper alloy or silver objects in the medieval period. This brooch can be confidently dated to the 12th-14th century based on form, with its flat rear and bevelled edges, along with its decorated surface and 'wonky' form. The 13th century seems to have been the high point for medieval annular brooches. A range of decoration, which is hard to find before the 13th century, exploded across annular brooches, which need not be circular, but encompassed lozengiform and multifoil frames, such as this example (Egan in Griffiths et al. 2007, 138-151). Decorated hexagonal brooches of this form are fairly common to this period, though usually contain extra decoration such as 'bosses' or 'knops' to strengthen and decorate the brooch (Egan & Pritchard 2002, pp. 257-8, no.1346).References:Egan, G. in Griffiths, D., et al.

The object bears numerous casting inclusions, one notable inclusion 9.1mm deep  and approximately 5.7mm in diameter  centrally on one corner edge. A second inclusion can be seen off-centre at the transverse break of the object. This possibly contributed to the break due to structural weakness. The heavy pitting on the object may be a result of high-lead content, as it never truly alloys, becoming miniscule globules of lead in the bronze which can create localised galvanic corrosion cells.	It is suggested that it is of late bronze age to early iron in date due to the high lead content, as similar examples of high-lead content ""votive"" axes exist from this period.Dr. Peter Chowne of the University of York comments that this object is possible slag or a very miscast axe, and would have likely been considered casting waste.","Length: 31.2mm, Width: 29.8mm, Thickness: 15.3mm, Weight: 44.3g",Cast,Copper alloy,St. Mary,Bronze Age 2600-701 BCE,Iron Age 700-51 BCE,01/08/2021,Cultivated land,Metal detector,Fragment,

A second set of diagonal lines begins at the bottom of the previous lines, but only a small portion of these lines remain due to the break in the object. This decoration is reminiscent of a Roman ""fasces"" symbol, consisting of a bundle of sticks tied around an axe.The broken surface of the object contains what may be a casting fault or the remnant of a bored hole just off centre towards the decorated side of the object. This hole is 3.48mm deep.The surface of the object has a brown and green patina.

cebc5ac7-2f50-4d91-809a-7924dd43c793,0900444,Maul,Possibly,"Worked pebble of local granite oval in shape. A shallow groove has been pecked around the circumference of the object lengthways at its middle point.The pebble is of igneous local granite, pinkish-grey in colour, with quartz crystalline inclusions. The pebble is attractive and smooth. The groove has been pecked on the surface of the rock to form a shallow groove approximately 1.9mm deep and varying in width from  c.9mm to c.7.5mm. This groove may have been to retain of a withy to be attached to a haft. Each face of the hammer bears minor evidence of wear, including pecking and possible abrasion. Similar grooved pebbles identified as Bronze Age mining mauls or hammers have been recorded in Britain (Timberlake & Craddock, 2013). Most of the mauls appear slightly different in form, the groove being pecked widthways around the pebble instead of lengthways. Further, the groove of the object is generally shallower than British examples, such as this sandstone example find GAT-09E9E4 recorded on the Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS). This may be explained by the extremely hard nature of local granite over softer stones like sandstone, and implies that this object would have taken a large amount of effort to create.No currently known ore mining sites exist on the island, other than small amounts of zinc and silver lead which were not mined in the Bronze Age. This maul may have been created for a use other than mining, such as a general tool or weapon. Further, it may have had a ceremonial function, as suggested in PAS GAT-09E9E4.An alternative suggestion may be a type of fishing weight. Additionally, very similar carved stone Native American war-clubs exist in the US, though the nature of the granite rules out this explanation.Sources:Portable Antiquities Scheme GAT-09E9E4Timerlak, S. & Craddock, B.

f0358b02-2ba8-4d77-b379-9c9f405444b8,1000331,Axe (tool),Certain,"An incomplete copper alloy miniature flat axe or possibly a chisel, possibly dating from the early to middle Bronze Age (2050 BC- 1200BC).The axe appears to have had straight sides, expanding into a cutting edge, which curves to a cutting edge. There may be slight evidence of flanged on either side with a slight concave towards the centre, though heavy erosion makes this uncertain. There is a clean break removing the butt of the object. The profile of the axe is lenticular.The surface is heavily pitted with the brownish-green patina of copper-alloy.The shape of the object ""heel"" bears resemblance to Normandy Type axes of the middle bronze age, though the lack of diagnostic features makes it impossible to identify for certain (Briard, J; 1976).This object's form is similar to full-sized, solid flat axes, resembling a smaller version of the earliest and simplest solid cast copper alloy axe-heads with tapering sides and rounded butts. It is uncertain whether it is a miniature axe or a chisel intended for fine working or was intended as a votive object; it is larger than other miniature axes (eg. Portable Antiquities Scheme: HAMP-B3BE22, HAMP-657353) which have been proposed to have a votive function (Robinson, P; 1995).Miniature flat axes such as this tend to fit in the chronology at the very end of the early Bronze Age when developed axes are starting out. It is likely that this example is dated to the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II-III), of metalworking tradition phase IV-V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2050 - 1700 CAL. BC. Axes of this size and form are difficult to parallel, Schmidt & Burgess (1981) catalogue a number of small developed flat axes as Variant Swinton (p 67-8, nos. 375-380) but all examples are between 87mm and 92mm in length.

19c3e2b8-7546-445b-a2aa-45ef22669cea,1200356,Dagger,Probable,"Cast copper alloy fragment of a dagger or rapier of Middle Bronze Age date.The object is sub-rectangular in plan and a long pointed oval or lenticular in cross-section. The object is broken and abraded on all sides. Both faces on each side of the object are decorated by two groups of five incised transverse lines, that curve gently towards each other. A slight raised triangle rises from the base of the middle of one face of the object. Dr. Peter Chowne of York University comments: ""This is part of a dagger or rapier that in a British context would fall in Burgess and Gerloff's Group 1 (weapons with multiple grooves without a central rib). They are found in Ireland and the Britsh Isles. In a French/Jersey context it belongs in the Tréboul group see Briard 1965: figs. 26 and 27. In Britain this would date to the Acton Park phase the earliest Middle Bronze Age. In France, Bronze moyen 1/BzB, vers 1600/1550-1450/1400 av. J.-C. Bronze moyen is used for continental France but French BA specialists have started to use an Atalantic chronology given the Iberian-Irish spread of some metalwork traditions therefore BzB.""References: Briard, J. & Verron, G.

Each face of the object is flat. The object has clean breaks at each end. One long edge has many purposeful incision marks, causing the surface to have small saw-like teeth. The object is fairly abraded all over, causing the risen ends of the 'teeth' to be rounded.This object may be a fragment of a Bronze Age saw, though the teeth are smaller than definite examples, possibly due to abrasion. ","Length: 70.59mm, Width: 21.25mm, Thickness: 3.74mm, Weight: 31.8mm.",Cast,Copper alloy,Trinity,Bronze Age 2600-701 BCE,Medieval 934-1539 CE,Post-2015,Cultivated land,Metal detector,Fragment,
7bcb796b-fabe-403b-80d4-c9ca49b82883,1200358,Axehead,Certain,"An incomplete Neolithic axehead made of polished flint. The axehead is irregular and asymmetrical in plan, with long, slightly curving sides leading to an asymmetric abraded edge. The axehead is very worn, with a large chip on a face above the butt, and a number of large chips on a corner of the butt. The edge of the axe is also chipped on one corner. Each face bears an uneven bevel, sloping down to a highly polished surface to its edge. The surface before this highly polished edge, towards the butt, is less polished and retains lengthways striations where it has been ground during manufacture. The sides of the axehead are relatively flat and ground, and the butt of the axehead is mostly flat. The axehead shows some signs of reworking on its edge, implying use as a tool. The axehead is a pointed oval in section.The flint is mid-grey in colour.This axehead is said to have been found with another axehead, which was subsequently lost by the finder.This axehead was previously published in the Societe Jersiaise Annual Bulletin (2014, p. 259). References:Waterhouse, R.
