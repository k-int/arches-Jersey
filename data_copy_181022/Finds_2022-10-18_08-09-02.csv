This broadly trapezoid plate bears a depiction of two  stylised mirrored 'birds' facing outwards from the centre of the object. The eyes of the birds are formed of concentric circles of yellow champleve enamel.  Next to each eye on the object protrudes  a downward pointing triangular beak, containing a triangular cell that was likely also enamelled.  Between the heads of the birds lies a central lozenge shaped cell with remaining traces of enamel, flanked  on its upper sides by two triangular cells. Beneath this lozenge cell  is a third concentric circle, identical to each birds eye. Either side of this circle are three rectangular cells moving at a diagonal angle to meet the heads of the birds, making up the ""bodies"" of the birds. The middle of each of these rectangular cells still hold their yellow enamelling.  Champleve enamelling was a popular technique in the Gallo-Roman period through to the Early Medieval period. Glass is fired to form a solid and fused onto a metal surface, usually placed inside shapes made by thin wire or laid into incised areas of the surface.  The rear of the object bears a side-handle mount.   Kevil Leahy, the Portable Antiquity Scheme National Finds Adviser of Early Medieval metalwork comments:  ""'I think that this find many well be indeed Irish, the champleve enamel resembles that used on the Oseberg enamelled mount.

The object bears numerous casting inclusions, one notable inclusion 9.1mm deep  and approximately 5.7mm in diameter  centrally on one corner edge. A second inclusion can be seen off-centre at the transverse break of the object. This possibly contributed to the break due to structural weakness. The heavy pitting on the object may be a result of high-lead content, as it never truly alloys, becoming miniscule globules of lead in the bronze which can create localised galvanic corrosion cells. 	 It is suggested that it is of late bronze age to early iron in date due to the high lead content, as similar examples of high-lead content ""votive"" axes exist from this period.

The front side of the buckle consists of a bevelled semi-circular frame that has been broken and bent inward sharply. The outside edge of the  frame bears simple, consistent grooved line decoration. Attached to the top edge of the frame is a small cylindrical protrusion 3mm in length. Attached to the bottom edge of the frame is a protruding bar 11.88mm long of unknown use. This may have once held a suspension loop for a dagger or sword, such as the following PAS examples: SUR-583B1C LEIC-8DB9A4, SUR-33A58C.  The central bar widens significantly to create a hinged pin constriction at its centre. The pin remains intact though slightly bent, is 20.96mm in length  and 2.23mm in thickness.  The back side of the buckle consists of a bevelled trapezoid frame that is undecorated. At the top end of this frame is a protrusion c 3mm in length that runs parallel to the small protrusion towards the front of the buckle, possibly decorative in fashion.

Local diorite can be found in the Ronez/Sorel area and between Elizabeth Castle and Seymour Tower.  Bevel-ended stone tools are common finds from the prehistoric period. These elongated stone artefacts are a common feature of the Middle Mesolithic of northern France and the Channel Islands (Ghesquière et al. 2000). They are often associated with Mesolithic coastal midden sites and also Neolithic and Bronze Age flint-knapping activities.  They are sometimes referred to as ‘limpet hammers’ as in more recent times people have also used tools like these for extracting limpets from rocks. These tools are usually long beach pebbles of local stone which show use/wear on one or both ends. Some have ends that have been rubbed smooth through abrasion, whilst others appear to have been used for percussion, probably as hammer stones (Conneller 2016). Through experimental archaeology and use-wear analysis, suggested uses for these tools are varied, and include, flint and stone knapping, hide-working, the crushing and grinding of foodstuffs and limpet collection and processing. There may be some overlap in function with bevel-ended tools made of bone and antler. When found out of context as in this case, it is hard to assign an exact date or use.

This button is single-piece. The button is very worn and abraded.   On the obverse, the button bears a very worn crest consisting of 2 ovals between a unicorn/horse on the left with a Maltese cross at its shoulder, and a lion on the right. Below the crest is a line of floral decoration atop a ribbon with the inscription ""FOR MY KING AND COUNTRY"". Above the crest is a knights helmet between an illegible inscription.  This appears to the be arms of General Sir Colin Halkett (born 7th September 1774, died 24th September 1856), and his wife Letitia Cricket whom married whilst Lieutenant Governor of Jersey. He was appointed to that office in 1821. The general's arms are shown on the dexter surrounded by the circlet of the Military Division of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath. He was appointed a Knight commander in 1815 and advanced a Knight Grand Cross in 1847. His wife's arms are shown sinister oval impaled with those of her husband. The oval is environed with a wreath in order to balance the Bath circlet around her husbands arms. These arms are no longer visible on this button.   John Tunesi of the University of Strathclyde kindly comments:  ""The general's arms may be blazoned as follows: 'Sable three piles argent on a chief gules a lion passant' - the Crest 'A falcon's head erased proper' - the Supporters (dexter) 'A horse gorged with a chaplet of laurel vert therefrom suspended the Peninsula medal inscribed in an escroll beneath 'Vento del poso'' (sinister) 'A lion reguardant gorged with a chaplet of laurel or pendant therefrom the Waterloo medal and ribbon'. The motto over the crest probably reads 'Fides sufficit' [Faith sufficeth]. A secondary motto 'For my king and country' appears below the arms together other insignia. I presume that his wife's arms of Cricket were either 'Vert a cross couped and pierced or on a chief argent three crescents gules' or 'Argent three drakes' heads erased proper'.""  The reverse of the button  bears a very abraded inscription surrounding a fixed loop. Above the loop reads the text ""NUTTI-"".  This very likely said ""J.

This seal matrix is conical in shape and has a worn pierced trefoil terminal and a worn collar on the handle. There is no identifiable orientation mark due to the condition of the matrix as it has a rough edge where this mark would have been. The engraved die is somewhat worn resulting in detail of the design and letters in the inscription being hard to decipher. Therefore a cast was taken of the seal matrix which allowed the die's features to become more visible. The central design appears to depict a flower, possibly a rose, with leaves on both sides of the stem. Due to the worn surface of the die it is not clear whether or not the matrix originally had a division between the design and inscription.

It has some iron staining in places and a small amount missing from one corner.   Bevel-ended stone tools are common finds from the prehistoric period. These elongated stone artefacts are a common feature of the Middle Mesolithic of northern France and the Channel Islands (Ghesquière et al. 2000). They are often associated with Mesolithic coastal midden sites and also Neolithic and Bronze Age flint-knapping activities.  They are sometimes referred to as ‘limpet hammers’ as in more recent times people have also used tools like these for extracting limpets from rocks.  These tools are usually long beach pebbles of local stone which show use/wear on one or both ends. Some have ends that have been rubbed smooth through abrasion, whilst others appear to have been used for percussion, probably as hammer stones (Conneller 2016).  Through experimental archaeology and use-wear analysis, suggested uses for these tools are varied, and include, flint and stone knapping, hide-working, the crushing and grinding of foodstuffs and limpet collection and processing. There may be some overlap in function with bevel-ended tools made of bone and antler.  When found out of context as in this case, it is hard to assign an exact date or use.

The opposite narrow terminal has a similar tab although at its end it becomes wider and spreads into a two lobed fan. This then folds into a second hook.  The front clasp is decorated in a stamped image of a stylised eagle facing to the right, with a striped shield in its centre. The eagle holds four arrows in its left claw and a herb, possibly wheat, in the right. A row of 11 stars are above the eagles head. There appears to have possibly been more stars above this row, but wear makes it difficult to say for certain.

The main fabric of the pottery is a orange-cream colour, and is very hard and smooth.  This pottery style was widely used and exported, originating from Siegburg, Germany. Around the mid-16th century, potters of Siegburg began to use mould technology to apply relief ornamentation to vessels, such as tankards. This ornamentation usually took the form of heraldic devices or motifs.  Salt-glazing is created when a large amount of salt is thrown into the kiln at a temperature of 1100 to 1250 degrees Celsius.

It appears to be copying the form of a Roman emperor, wearing a laurel wreath over short hair, tied with a loop at the nape of the neck. This is where the classical similarities end however, as the laurel leaves face backwards, are of odd sizes, and there are traces above and below the wreath of elaborately sweptback hair. A possible torc is worn at the neck, apparently resting on the shoulders and falling to front and rear. The ears are prominent and kidney-shaped, while the over-large eyes are decidedly lentoid, swept back towards the ears in Celtic fashion. The face is very worn, so the nose is almost invisible, but appears to form a long triangular shape. The mouth is a straight line with circular indents at its extremities. Comparison with other examples from Britain and France show that this was the pommel of a full-length late Iron Age sword, probably of La Tene III type, dating to the mid- | late first century BC. An example found in a 264 warrior grave at North Grimston, Lincolnshire (Plate 6) now in Hull Museum shows how the head would have been mounted, in the saddle between the two raised arms of a bronze hilt which would have had two similar legs at the bottom functioning as a guard. The tang of the sword passed through a hole which ran the full length of the cast bronze hilt and through the pommel, the soft iron tip of the tang being carefully hammered to spread it into the countersunk hole at the crown of the pommel, preventing the components from coming apart in battle. In addition to the North Grimston sword, an extremely fine Gaulish example, again with a head bearing mixed Celtic and Roman features is held in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Swords with anthropoid hilts are characteristic of Celtic Europe in the first century BC, with fifty or so surviving from this period. They were often included in richly-fitted graves, suggesting that they were the valued property of aristocratic warriors. The tradition of creating anthropoid hilts of this form was long lived and had its origins in the middle Iron Age of Continental Europe with known examples from France, Germany, Czechoslovakia and as far West as Ballyshannon Bay in County Donegal, Ireland. These are dated to the second and first centuries BC and many are cast in one piece. The casting of hilts in two pieces as in the case of the Jersey example seems to be a development of the mid-first century BC. This is a very exciting find for Jersey, no other late Iron Age swords or parts of them having been identified to date (although Guernsey has several from the Middle Iron Age). A find of a late second century BC Roman silver denarius in the same field is presumably  significant, and further research into the site is planned by the author and the finder.",,Incomplete,,,,Dimensions:	29.5mm x 18mm x 11mm Weight: 22.73g,2017-06-13,,,,,,,/files/uploadedfiles/0900431_-_Iron_age_pommel.JPG,Cultivated,Cast,Copper alloy,Metric,Millimetres/grams,Sword pommel,Certain,St. Ouen,,St. Ouen,,0900431,,Metal detector,,,GEOMETRYCOLLECTION (POINT (-2.097996 49.182965)),Findspot known as ‘St. Ouen’; accurate location protected and marked as Jersey Archive.,,,Donated to SJ,

This seal matrix is vesica shaped (oval with pointed ends), 32.69mm long, 20.59mm wide, 3.00mm thick and 6.4g in weight. These seals were used mainly by women, ecclesiastical figures or secular clergy. The obverse of the seal is flat, with a depiction split into an upper and lower register. The upper register depicts ""The Shrine of the Nursing Madonna"" the Virgin Mary nursing Jesus beneath an arch, flanked by two towers with pointed finials. The lower register bears a praying prior or abbot beneath a winged dome, probably meant to represent a  pitched church roof.  The reverse of the matrix, behind the upper pointed end, are the remains of a lug (3.01mm in width, and would have been c 7.01mm in length).  The legend surrounding the device reads: +AVE.MARIA.GRA.PLENA.DMS.TEC “Ave Maria Gratia Plena Dominus Tecum”  This is the ""Hail Mary"", a traditional Catholic prayer in Latin. As this anonymous inscription does not name an individual, it may have been a ready-made seal distributed to various lesser church dignitaries.   Harvey & McGuinness (1996) illustrate a similar seal matrix  dated c.1292: ""Seals of lesser church dignitaries followed a pattern similar to bishops' seals though smaller in size. Thus they are usually a pointed oval, by the late thirteenth century showing a saint - here the Virgin and Child - with suppliant figure below"" (ibid, 74).  Ref: Harvey, P.D.A. & McGuiness, A.

The object is oval in shape with both ends being rounded and tapered. One end narrows slightly more than the other. In profile it is lentoid in shape and its cross section is a similar lentoid shape. The 'cutting' edge is rounded, from the external edges it tapers gradually until it forms a narrowed but rounded butt. There is no sign of a stop ridge or any form of cast design. It is thickest at the mid-point. The surface of the object is slightly eroded and corroded, the whole surface covered in patina. It is a dark - mid green colour. The edges on all sides of the object are very rounded, through either cast design or corrosion.  A parallel can be found from Ireland, which was the main source of copper during the Chalcolithic period in Atlantic Europe (Harbison 1969).  It has also been suggested that this is an axe blank. Needham (2016, p.38-9) states: ""...there are still a small number of rather amorphous objects – oval, sub-triangular, pear-shaped – of small size. They can also be rather thin, so little metal is present, and they may have unusual, non-lenticular profiles. Some of these at least do not appear to be badly eroded examples of finished axes; moreover, they are too small to have been destined for working up into standard sized axes. Without more detailed study, it is difficult to attribute a function, but they could have served an ingot function – that is, to facilitate the distribution of raw metal... The alternative is that they too are blanks, but despite their vaguely axe-like shape, they were for other implements.  Ref: Needham, S. (2017).

The main body of the object remains and is 55mm x 29mm x 19mm and weighs 37.13g. It is incomplete due to a fragment missing on the base of the object. This may have been lost due to plough damage as the object was discovered in a cultivated field. The Star of David/six-pointed star decoration gives the object an irregular shape. In the centre of the star is the letter ‘I’ but some have interpreted this as a chalice because of the pronounced serifs. Between the points of the star are semi-circles with varying diameters. The two ‘upper’ points contain florets, with small dots in the ‘lower’ points. There is also light hatching behind the ‘I’ and a slightly more prominent crosshatch across the majority of the base. The base’s shape is a rectangle on top of an inverted trapezium. There is also a crescent shape at a similar depth to the semi-circles which links the top to the base. The reverse consists of two curves. The curve behind the top of the object has a small hole or suspension loop. This shape seems to be unusual but perhaps was used for particularly thick material as it would have been attached to a cap or clothing. The object is somewhat worn, more so in some places, and is grey in colour with orange discoloration in areas, particularly in the crevices. It has an even and stable copper corrosion product surface.  John McCormack (2020) has researched this object and highlights several aspects of the object including that the object may have had an additional piece at the top, possibly a filament as well as suggesting that the ‘I’ stands for ‘Jhesu’. This is based on information from ‘Symboles’ published by Zodiacque, page 56, which explains that a six-pointed star/the Star of David was used to denote power and therefore Christ and his descent from the kings of Israel, David and Solomon.  McCormack’s (2020) research also compared the object to seal matrices: IOW-6A58A8 (Portable Antiquities Scheme Database) and M16-0224 and M16-0311 (Hammond 2014, 693, 709). As these include the ‘I’ as well as a floret similar to the angle of the badge which McCormack (2020) suggests may refer to the Virgin Mary. Another object which McCormack (2020) highlights is a quern stone discovered in Castel, Guernsey which also reflects the ‘I’ and may be of a similar date to the badge. McCormack (2020) has tentatively dated the stone as circa late 15th-early 16th century.  The object is significant due to the findspot’s proximity to the important local site, La Hougue Bie, as well as the likelihood of its uniqueness. McCormack (2020) suggests that the badge may have been owned by Dean Mabon, the Dean of Jersey and a rector of St Martin’s Parish. Mabon undertook a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and after his return reconstructed the eastern part of La Hougue Bie’s chapel to incorporate a crypt in 1520. The site became a local centre of pilgrimage. McCormack (2020) also suggests that he may have brought the badge back from the Holy Land or Mabon may have created the badge himself to sell to pilgrims but due to the possibility of the object being unique believes this is unlikely.   Further research is currently being undertaken and therefore this record will be updated in due course to reflect other interpretations.

It is sub-circular, 32.5mm in length and 30.5mm in width, and weighs 27.6g. The disk displays some corrosion and chipping on the faces and edge. It is inscribed with a cross or 'X' symbol on one face. The object appears to have been bent slightly lengthways, with the inscribed side becoming convex as a result. The object has a light grey patina.  This token may be a weight, the cross possibly representing a Roman numeral. Lead weights are common throughout the Medieval and Post-Medieval period. Biggs, N. & Withers, P. (2000) note that weights of this type with numerals are consistent with the Roman weight-system as well as the avoirdupois system, thus they could equally be post medieval in date.  Lead tokens had a wide variety of potential uses such as tallies, gaming pieces, tickets, weights, etc. and are believed to have been locally produced; they are therefore difficult to date precisely. Those carrying initials are generally deemed to be post medieval in date (1500-1850), those which seem to mimic medieval penny designs are deemed to be late medieval to early post medieval and the remainder which carry stylised designs remain difficult to date but the majority are probably post medieval in date c.AD 1500-1850.  The Powell classification system, in which there are over 30 categories, attempts to classify these leaden tokens according to the designs featured on each face, but it does not assign any chronology.

It is a dense, grey dolerite with purple streaks forming a looping organic pattern in halos around both flat faces and on the broader long edge. All narrow edges on the pebble have some degree of battering, parts of which are also fringed with purple. There is some slight chipping on either side of the long narrow edge that suggests it has been used as a hammer stone. Both flat faces have additionally been rubbed very smooth, against another hard surface. The surfaces of both flat faces have been the targets of heavy anvil activity resulting in two oval pits c. 20cm x 3.4cm on one face, and a c.2 x 6cm pit on the other face. This singular pit is an elongated groove with a deeper pit at one end coinciding with the purple halo. In several places, notably on its long broad edge and around the pits in the flat faces there are linear scars. This suggests the stone has been used as an anvil in the making of flint blades. A very similar multi-purpose stone tool, dated to the early Neolithic period, was found accompanied by flint debitage at Halkett Place in St Helier in the early 1920s and is described by Sinel (1923, Prehistoric Times and Men of the Channel Islands, p.79) as follows; ‘A flat diorite pebble, about 10 inches in length, 4 inches wide at its broadest end, and tapering to a point at the other. This seems to have served as an ordinary chopper, for its thinnest edge bears unmistakeable evidence of some such use.
