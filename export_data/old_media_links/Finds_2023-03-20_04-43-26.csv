It is 32mm in diameter and weighs 9.0g. There is a sub-rectangular hole at the top which would have been used for suspending the object.  The object is circular in plan with a damaged/sea worn surface due to being discovered on the beach. The obverse depicts the bust of Admiral Nelson facing left. His hair is somewhat long and he is wearing a uniform and possibly a sash of medals. The legend surrounding the bust is likely to read 'ENGLAND EXPECTS EVERY MAN WILL DO HIS DUTY', as this is the text clearly marked on other examples of this medal. These were the words which Nelson used as a signal to his fleet at the beginning of the battle of Trafalgar. The reverse depicts a three masted wooden sailing ship in rough water on the verge of sinking and large rocks can be seen in the background. From similar examples the legend should read 'SHIPWRECKED MARINERS SOCIETY'. The date at the base of the reverse may read 186?.  The Shipwrecked Fishermen and Mariners Royal Benevolent Society (shortened to Shipwrecked Mariners) was established in 1839 after the sinking of 11 fishing boats off the coast of Devon due to a severe storm in November 1838.

It has some iron staining in places and a small amount missing from one corner.   Bevel-ended stone tools are common finds from the prehistoric period. These elongated stone artefacts are a common feature of the Middle Mesolithic of northern France and the Channel Islands (Ghesquière et al. 2000). They are often associated with Mesolithic coastal midden sites and also Neolithic and Bronze Age flint-knapping activities.  They are sometimes referred to as 'limpet hammers' as in more recent times people have also used tools like these for extracting limpets from rocks.  These tools are usually long beach pebbles of local stone which show use/wear on one or both ends. Some have ends that have been rubbed smooth through abrasion, whilst others appear to have been used for percussion, probably as hammer stones (Conneller 2016).  Through experimental archaeology and use-wear analysis, suggested uses for these tools are varied, and include, flint and stone knapping, hide-working, the crushing and grinding of foodstuffs and limpet collection and processing. There may be some overlap in function with bevel-ended tools made of bone and antler.  When found out of context as in this case, it is hard to assign an exact date or use.

bda8fe32-fb70-11eb-8701-0275d4869ef4,,St. Brelade,Parish,Gallo-Roman 51 BCE-451 CE,Post Medieval 1540-1901 CE,"A Roman to Post-Medieval lead disk or token. It is sub-circular, 32.5mm in length and 30.5mm in width, and weighs 27.6g. The disk displays some corrosion and chipping on the faces and edge. It is inscribed with a cross or 'X' symbol on one face. The object appears to have been bent slightly lengthways, with the inscribed side becoming convex as a result. The object has a light grey patina.  This token may be a weight, the cross possibly representing a Roman numeral. Lead weights are common throughout the Medieval and Post-Medieval period. Biggs, N. & Withers, P. (2000) note that weights of this type with numerals are consistent with the Roman weight-system as well as the avoirdupois system, thus they could equally be post medieval in date.  Lead tokens had a wide variety of potential uses such as tallies, gaming pieces, tickets, weights, etc. and are believed to have been locally produced; they are therefore difficult to date precisely. Those carrying initials are generally deemed to be post medieval in date (1500-1850), those which seem to mimic medieval penny designs are deemed to be late medieval to early post medieval and the remainder which carry stylised designs remain difficult to date but the majority are probably post medieval in date c.AD 1500-1850.

The obverse and reverse of the object have been moderately corroded. The axe bears a crescent shaped blade with small indents showing that is has been hammered sharp.

The object appears to have been stamped after the incised lines were made.The band of the ring is bevelled, undulating at regular intervals to a lozenge-shaped flat surface, upon which is stamped with a sun shape. The bezel is not typical of Roman or Late Medieval to Post-Medieval signet rings, as it is convex and bears no heraldic or iconographic design.

Local diorite can be found in the Ronez/Sorel area and between Elizabeth Castle and Seymour Tower.  Bevel-ended stone tools are common finds from the prehistoric period. These elongated stone artefacts are a common feature of the Middle Mesolithic of northern France and the Channel Islands (Ghesquière et al. 2000). They are often associated with Mesolithic coastal midden sites and also Neolithic and Bronze Age flint-knapping activities.  They are sometimes referred to as 'limpet hammers' as in more recent times people have also used tools like these for extracting limpets from rocks. These tools are usually long beach pebbles of local stone which show use/wear on one or both ends. Some have ends that have been rubbed smooth through abrasion, whilst others appear to have been used for percussion, probably as hammer stones (Conneller 2016). Through experimental archaeology and use-wear analysis, suggested uses for these tools are varied, and include, flint and stone knapping, hide-working, the crushing and grinding of foodstuffs and limpet collection and processing. There may be some overlap in function with bevel-ended tools made of bone and antler. When found out of context as in this case, it is hard to assign an exact date or use.

Beyond the break the axe widens on each side, ending in a concave but assymetric blade. The surface of the object and blade edge are heavily abraded and pitted. The object bears numerous casting inclusions, one notable inclusion 9.1mm deep  and approximately 5.7mm in diameter  centrally on one corner edge. A second inclusion can be seen off-centre at the transverse break of the object. This possibly contributed to the break due to structural weakness. The heavy pitting on the object may be a result of high-lead content, as it never truly alloys, becoming miniscule globules of lead in the bronze which can create localised galvanic corrosion cells. 	 It is suggested that it is of late bronze age to early iron in date due to the high lead content, as similar examples of high-lead content ""votive"" axes exist from this period.

The opposite narrow terminal has a similar tab although at its end it becomes wider and spreads into a two lobed fan. This then folds into a second hook.

The eagle holds four arrows in its left claw and a herb, possibly wheat, in the right. A row of 11 stars are above the eagles head. There appears to have possibly been more stars above this row, but wear makes it difficult to say for certain.

This pottery style was widely used and exported, originating from Siegburg, Germany. Around the mid-16th century, potters of Siegburg began to use mould technology to apply relief ornamentation to vessels, such as tankards. This ornamentation usually took the form of heraldic devices or motifs.

Salt-glazing is created when a large amount of salt is thrown into the kiln at a temperature of 1100 to 1250 degrees Celsius.

This button is single-piece. The button is very worn and abraded.   On the obverse, the button bears a very worn crest consisting of 2 ovals between a unicorn/horse on the left with a Maltese cross at its shoulder, and a lion on the right. Below the crest is a line of floral decoration atop a ribbon with the inscription ""FOR MY KING AND COUNTRY"". Above the crest is a knights helmet between an illegible inscription.  This appears to the be arms of General Sir Colin Halkett (born 7th September 1774, died 24th September 1856), and his wife Letitia Cricket whom married whilst Lieutenant Governor of Jersey. He was appointed to that office in 1821. The general's arms are shown on the dexter surrounded by the circlet of the Military Division of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath. He was appointed a Knight commander in 1815 and advanced a Knight Grand Cross in 1847. His wife's arms are shown sinister oval impaled with those of her husband. The oval is environed with a wreath in order to balance the Bath circlet around her husbands arms. These arms are no longer visible on this button.   John Tunesi of the University of Strathclyde kindly comments:  ""The general's arms may be blazoned as follows: 'Sable three piles argent on a chief gules a lion passant' - the Crest 'A falcon's head erased proper' - the Supporters (dexter) 'A horse gorged with a chaplet of laurel vert therefrom suspended the Peninsula medal inscribed in an escroll beneath 'Vento del poso'' (sinister) 'A lion reguardant gorged with a chaplet of laurel or pendant therefrom the Waterloo medal and ribbon'. The motto over the crest probably reads 'Fides sufficit' [Faith sufficeth]. A secondary motto 'For my king and country' appears below the arms together other insignia. I presume that his wife's arms of Cricket were either 'Vert a cross couped and pierced or on a chief argent three crescents gules' or 'Argent three drakes' heads erased proper'.""  The reverse of the button  bears a very abraded inscription surrounding a fixed loop. Above the loop reads the text ""NUTTI-"".  This very likely said ""J.

A slight indent at the base may indicate that a small piece has been chiselled away. Slight faults in the metal on the edge and near the edge on the reverse suggests that it was cast, not struck. The city state of Carthage in modern Tunisia was one of the first Mediterranean states to begin minting coins. Shekels commonly included designs of the face of the goddess Tanit, horses or Melqart (Hercules). This particular issue features the face of Tanit on one side and a galloping horse on the reverse. This particular issue was minted at Kerkouane, Cape Bon, Tunisia, during a period of resistance against the invading Roman consul Marcus Regulas, during the First Punic War, 264-241 BC. Towards the end of the Punic War, the empire coined a large quantity of devaluated coins to settle revolting mercenaries within the empire.

The figure is broken away at the waist, immediately below the navel, the shallow boring of which may have provided a point of weakness. The body is of slight build and reasonably well modelled at least on the front, but the back is rough. The right arm is bent at the elbow but as the hand is missing there is no indication of any attribute. The navel and nipples are indicated by shallow borings (the nipple on the left of the body having been lost through corrosion). In relation to the body, the pear-shaped head is massive. It is turned to the left (i.e. the viewer's right). The physiognomy is dominated by large eyes with heavy brows, the pupil of the right eye is bored and the slit mouth is emphasised by heavy lips. As far as can be seen, the nose is flat and triangular, but wear and corrosion have made detail indistinct. Ears are barely indicated by depressions at the sides of the head. The crown is flattened and slopes backwards. The surface here is badly corroded. Dimensions: Surviving height 38 mm; greatest width 28 mm; depth of body 6 mm; depth of head (from the chin to the crown of the head) 12 mm. While the tradition of naturalistic bronzecasting is a Mediterranean one, which only becomes widespread in north-westem Europe with the coming of the Roman Empire, this bronze is in no way related to Roman bronzes of the Imperial period, although it is not unlike some clearly native figurines made in the North of Italy from the fourth to the second century BC (Franzoni 1980, 121-158, nos 100-137). It seems that these were imported across the Alps and up the RhBne valley and copied in Gaul (Boucher 1976, 13-43); especially close is the figure from Pointe du Raz in Western Brittany (ibid. 35, fig. 35). The prototype was probably an Italic Hercules (Franzoni, op. cit.), but it is not known what such a bronze might have symbolised in Gaul. It is worth mentioning that early bronzes are known from Britain. Actual Italic bronzes are recorded from Mount Batten, Plymouth (Cunliffe 1988, 70-72, nos 128, 129). Two very fine female figurines of Iron Age date come from Aust-by-Severn (Cunliffe 1978, 155, and plate 22b, but not Iberian as stated); and from Henley Wood (Wilson 1970,296 and plate XXXVd) . Male figures are recorded from Dartmoor (Christie's Antiquities Sale Catalogue, 16 December 1982,8, lot 24), and from Maiden Castle (in the Dorset County Museum, Dorchester) . All of these bronzes are from sites in south-western Britain."". Post-publication, the legs of this figurine were found, and the figurine now resides in the Jersey Heritage collection.References: Henig, M. and Wood, M.

It consists of a cylindrical frame with two hammered flat rectangular strands wound tightly around it. The terminals of the bracelet cross over and are rounded. One side of the bracelet has been damaged with some of the cord missing, which allows a look at the interior frame construction of the object. The object has patches of dark to light green patina which has fused with beach sand.  The small size of the bracelet suggests that it was for a child or small woman.  Sally Worrell, National Finds Adviser for Prehistoric, Iron Age and Roman Artefacts identifies the bracelet as ""TYPE 14: a bronze bracelet fashioned by wrapping bronze wire tightly around a shank""   (Allason-Jones and Miket, 1984).  Wire bracelets of similar technology and construction also show up numerously in Roman contexts  in Southern England (Portable Antiquities Scheme:  SOM-E1DFB1, WMID-0177C3, ASHM-CE0919).  Some similar two strand wire bracelet examples from the Netherlands have been dated to the Early Iron Age (Arnoldussen & Steegstra 2001, 83, DB 1031).

The two larger fragments have the same pale green surface patina, while the smaller fragment appears to have a break matching the median piece, suggesting that all three came from the same weapon.

Each of these lines is about 003mm wide and about 0.7mm apart, forming bands 4.6mm wide, which are very slightly convex over their length.  The larger pieces both have gas bubbles in their broken faces; these are plough-battered, with pale green bronze disease, so were broken in antiquity.  Dirks or short swords of Treboul type (named after the place in Brittany where weapons with this type of decoration were first identified), with the handle being riveted to the blade just above its unusually broad head, were manufactured in Armorica (present-day Brittany and Western Normandy) between c.1500-1200 BC.

The object has patches of dark to light green patina which has fused with beach sand.The small size of the bracelet suggests that it was for a child or small woman.Sally Worrell, National Finds Adviser for Prehistoric, Iron Age and Roman Artefacts identifies the bracelet as ""TYPE 14: a bronze bracelet fashioned by wrapping bronze wire tightly around a shank""   (Allason-Jones and Miket, 1984).Wire bracelets of similar technology and construction also show up numerously in Roman contexts  in Southern England (Portable Antiquities Scheme:  SOM-E1DFB1, WMID-0177C3, ASHM-CE0919).Some similar two strand wire bracelet examples from the Netherlands have been dated to the Early Iron Age (Arnoldussen & Steegstra 2001, 83, DB 1031).References: Allason-Jones and Miket (1984), ""The Catalogue of Small Finds from South Shields Roman Fort"". ",,Incomplete,,,,"Length: 56.26mm, Width: 44mm, Cable Thickness c.4.5mm (varying), Weight: 15.7g.",01/02/2021,,,,,,,"http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/[{u'status': u'uploaded',http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/u'index': 0,http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/u'name': u'0200221 - bracelet.jpg',http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/0200221_-_bracelet.jpg',http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/u'lastModified': 1629275389593,http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/u'height': 1427,http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/c259dc30-c106-4fa8-bc7b-b93e753db10c',http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/u'width': 2504,http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/u'file_id': u'aff69374-0022-11ec-8701-0275d4869ef4',http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/u'accepted': True,http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/jpeg',http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/u'size': 1039818},http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/{u'status': u'uploaded',http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/u'index': 0,http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/u'name': u'0200221 - bracelet 2.jpg',http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/0200221_-_bracelet_2.jpg',http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/u'lastModified': 1629276089270,http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/u'height': 1232,http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/94e67eaf-573f-4f13-8a0f-79fbb576aa66',http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/u'width': 1014,http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/u'file_id': u'3ba6e798-0023-11ec-8701-0275d4869ef4',http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/u'accepted': True,http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/jpeg',http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/u'size': 341780}]",Intertidal,Struck or hammered,Copper alloy,Metric,Millimetres/grams,Bracelet,Certain,,,,,300385,,Metal detector,,,,,,,,

This broadly trapezoid plate bears a depiction of two  stylised mirrored 'birds' facing outwards from the centre of the object. The eyes of the birds are formed of concentric circles of yellow champleve enamel.  Next to each eye on the object protrudes  a downward pointing triangular beak, containing a triangular cell that was likely also enamelled.  Between the heads of the birds lies a central lozenge shaped cell with remaining traces of enamel, flanked  on its upper sides by two triangular cells. Beneath this lozenge cell  is a third concentric circle, identical to each birds eye. Either side of this circle are three rectangular cells moving at a diagonal angle to meet the heads of the birds, making up the ""bodies"" of the birds. The middle of each of these rectangular cells still hold their yellow enamelling.  Champleve enamelling was a popular technique in the Gallo-Roman period through to the Early Medieval period. Glass is fired to form a solid and fused onto a metal surface, usually placed inside shapes made by thin wire or laid into incised areas of the surface.  The rear of the object bears a side-handle mount.   Kevil Leahy, the Portable Antiquity Scheme National Finds Adviser of Early Medieval metalwork comments:  ""'I think that this find many well be indeed Irish, the champleve enamel resembles that used on the Oseberg enamelled mount. I don't think that it's a brooch and feel that it is best interpreted as a side-handle mount from a house-shrine - the loop fitting looks right for this.

In the left arm, she holds an upraised cornucopia against her body and a staff or part of her toga hangs down beneath it. A potted flower is on the ground at her feet to the left. The letters S and C are either side of the figure, and traces of an inscription at the top read XIX to the left and II?I to the right. The obverse has the tall, bearded head of Marcus Aurelius (who ruled from 161 to 180 AD) facing right, with a long nose and his beard in three tufts. He has tightly curled hair and a laurel wreath with a bow and curved tassels to the rear. No inscription survives on the obverse. There is possible evidence for clipping in the form of a notch on the edge with worn surfaces. This is some ancient damage and not from a modern cultivator.

To the bottom left of the animal is a partial letter, probably 'W' or 'N', though no other letters remain. Fleur-de-lis crowns above motifs were popular hallmarks or makers-marks on silver in the late 17th and 18th centuries.

The upper surface bears an incised design which may have been picked out in niello, although none exists. The central element of this design is symmetrical and appears to be addorsed (back to back) beasts in Urnes or Ringerike style. At the base a straight and almost right-angled flange projects rearwards. Just above the flange two rivet holes are obscured by an iron deposit at the front and rear.This mount is greyish brown. The iron is corroded.This is a typical example of Williams's Class A, Type 1 stirrup-strap mounts, a diverse group whose decorative content appears to be derived from the Scandinavian Urnes style (Williams 1997: 26-34, figs. 19-23).

Both feet survive, and calf and though muscles are clearly sculpted. A purposeful rounded square hole exists on the left side of the right knee, and appears to one have been used for a riveted attachment to another object, possibly another figurine.The figurines right arm is outstretched forward and raised slightly with a complete hand, whilst the left arm is stretching out to the side but broken at the elbow. Deep facial features are still visible on the figurines face, including eyes, nose and a mouth. A clear hairline frames the face, with incised locks of hair visible surrounding the face. Hair appears to be possibly pulled back in a pony tail, though this may be a form of head wear. Large ears exist at each side of the head, and possibly large earrings.  The figurine wears a beaded necklace around its neck hanging over its upper chest. The chest appears to be depicted bare and unclothed, with a garment bunched up around the figurines waist. A possible pouch hands at the waist on the figurines left side, though this may be part of the sculpted garment hanging from the left shoulder.This object may represent the god Mithras, who is commonly depicted slaughtering a bull. The bull may have been riveted to the figurine by the hole in the right leg. The object also bears a slightly similar pose to Neptune (fig. 245) or Attis (fig. 281) in Boucher (1976), though the figurine lacks diagnostic features to be given certain identification. The object is a shiny bronze in colour with some corrosion over its surface.

It is made from a four flanged stem of gold in a cruciform section that has been twisted. The ends terminate in a solid rod with a slight conical shape bent to form a hook. It is thought to have originated from Ireland.  Hawkes suggests that it was constructed by the a solid bar of gold chiselled away to form the four flanges in one piece without any solder.  The current shape of the torque is due to restoration work undertaken by the British Museum, April - November 1973.

A small-diameter ring with three protruding knops sits atop a thickened base with remains of a narrow strap loop below.  This would have been one of at least four such rings, fixed to the top of a yoke or collar, worn by a pair of horses, drawing a cart or chariot.  A single rein would have passed through the ring, whose small size suggests they must have been thin cords or finely braided leather.  Research by ASG Lewis in 2015 for a PhD at Leicester University suggested a late 1st-early 2nd century AD date for terrets of this type (Lewis 76).

Flanges emerge from the butt of the axe on each face, running almost its entire length save for the cutting edge itself. These flanges measure at a depth of c.10.04mm and c.6.42mm at the thickest point. The butt is uneven and flared, though flat, showing evidence of extensive hammering to its rear. the cutting edge of the blade is still very sharp and complete, except for two chips. Evidence of hammering and sharpening is visible at its edge.The axe is roughly lozenge shaped in profile, with faint but visible casting seams on each side, which appear to have been carefully filed. The axe is undecorated.The surface of the object is slightly abraded and almost entirely unpatinated due to its intertidal findspot, save for some recessed areas. The object is otherwise in very good condition, with clear unrolled edges, and likely sat on a deep surface layer below the sand. The axe most closely resembles those of Medoc type II (or 'medium type'), named after those found in Médoc in Southern France. This type is exemplified by its length, measuring from 140 to 160mm, and flange depth measuring 8mm to 11mm. The axehead does bear some similarity to Atlantic type axeheads, with its flaring cutting edge, but is significantly larger than axes of this type. Briard and Verron (1976, pp.51-52) highlight overlap between Medoc type axes and other forms, such as Atlantic types. This axe may represent some Medoc-Atlantic cross influence.Notes:Though the findspot of the axe was intertidal, it is found squarely in-line with the course of a valley and stream. The land and stream may have continued over the ancient land-surface of the time, and imply a purposeful deposition within a stream or its mouth, a common feature for Bronze Age Finds. References:Briard, J. and Verron, G. 1976.

fb394ed7-3ba6-475f-86f9-11e884735ee1,,St. Helier,,Early Medieval 450-933 CE,Early Medieval 450-933 CE,"Cast copper alloy strap fitting of the Early Medieval Period (c. early to mid 9th century).The fitting is plano-convex and sub rectangular. In plan, one end is rounded ('tongue-shaped') and the other end is a triple projection; each corner at two projecting triangles which slope inwards at around 80 degrees, before curving back out on each side to form a rounded central projection. At this end, the decoration at the face of the object ends and falls in c.2mm at a sharp angle creating a noticeable step. This is not visible on the rear of the object. The sides of the curved end narrow inwards slightly before gently flaring out again to create two 'shoulders' at around the centre of the object, from which the sides travel mostly straight until reaching the opposite end. The decorated face of the object is curved and convex, whilst the back of the object is entirely flat save for three mounting projection loops. The loops are cast vertically (the holes facing horizontally outwards). One loop is cast centrally on the back of the curved end of the object, whilst the other two sit horizontal from each other at the other end, sitting 3-4mm from each side. The object bears complex champlevÃ© enamel decoration that covers almost the entire face. The rounded half of the object bears a equal armed cross within a frame that is rounded on top and rectilinear at its bottom. This motif is surrounded radially on all sides except its base by small interlocking triangles at the fitting's edge. A small triangle channel protrudes from the centre of the rectilinear end of the cross' frame. Below this portion is a mirrored loop motif of two circles that contain two smaller circles resembling stylised eyes. Connecting these two circles is a wide loop below. Two large triangle channels reach the base of these circles, widening to a thick line across the 'shoulders' of the object. Below this line is a square of decoration, consisting of two rows of interlocking triangles radially surrounding a white (silvered) square interlocking four-looped knot design, rounded but for sharp angles that resembles a ""Solomon's Knot"" design. the object is relatively abraded by sea and sand, and the enamel is discoloured due to degradation.Barry Ager, former Curator of Prehistory and Europe at the British Museum kindly comments:""In outline the find has the form of a tongue-shaped strap-end of continental type from the late 7th century and later, but the three attachment lugs on the back make it impractical for use as one and it is most probably an ornamental mount from a strap. The absence of either animal or vegetal decoration, however, means that dating depends mainly on the use of champlevÃ© enamelling in the channels and triangular cells on the front. The enamel would originally have been red in colour, but has typically decayed to a powdery yellowish deposit.Leaving aside the Celtic enamelwork of Ireland and western Britain and the occasional use of red enamel spots on Anglo-Saxon jewellery of the 6th century, the earliest firmly dated enamel in western Europe is to be found on the Altheus reliquary dating from 780-799. This is cloisonnÃ© enamel, though, and the champlevÃ© technique is connected with the â€˜Carolingian renaissanceâ€™ and dates mostly from the 9th century onwards, as on several series of small disc brooches with cruciform designs (e.g. B. Ager, 1995, â€œRecent acquisitions of late Merovingian and Carolingian metalwork in the Department of Medieval and Later Antiquities in the British Museumâ€, ArchÃ¤ologisches Korrespondenzblatt, 25, pp. 253-263; see more recently R. Weetch, 2013, Brooches in Late Anglo-Saxon England within a North-West European Context: a study of social identities between the 8th and 11th century, unpublished PhD, Reading). (The red material rarely seen inlaid on earlier Merovingian belt-fittings is not true enamel, but a form of lead-oxide glass.)The form of the Jersey fitting appears to derive via Frankish Europe from Mediterranean/Italian strap-ends, such as the imported, silver-plated, copper-alloy example of c. 700 from St Peter Lahr-Burgheim, gr. 19, Germany, which also has a square top end curving in to a tongue-shaped terminal (see attachment, scanned from Jahrbuch des RÃ¶misch-Germanischen Zentralmuseum Mainz, 51.1, 2004, p. 361, Abb. 10.1; but Iâ€™m afraid I donâ€™t have the full ref.). The triple projections across its â€˜topâ€™ end occur on late Merovingian belt-fittings, e.g. the silver-plated belt-set from FÃ©tigny, Switzerland (scanned from M. Schulze-DÃ¶rrlamm, 1998, Das karolingische Kreuz von Baume-les-Messieurs, dÃ©p. Jura, mit Tierornamenten im frÃ¼hen Tassilokelchstil, ArchÃ¤ologisches Korrespondenzblatt, 28, 131-150, Abb. 9, 2) and on the BÃ¼lach and Bern-Solothurn types; examples of the latter have been found in England at Southampton and Ipswich (V. Birbeck, R.J.C. Smith, P. Andrews & N. Stoodley, 2005, The origins of Mid-Saxon Southampton: excavations at the Friends Provident St Maryâ€™s Stadium 1998-2000, Wessex Archaeology, Salisbury, p. 63). On Carolingian strap-ends the top end is straight and the incurved sides of the tongue have been replaced by a bevelled edge, which gives a somewhat similar appearance, e.g. the late 8th/early 9th-century find from the Waal near Rossum, Netherlands, with a parallel from Ingelheim, Germany (see attachment, scanned from C. Stiegemann & M. Wemhoff (eds), 1999, 799. Kunst und Kultur der Karolingerzeit: Karl der GroÃŸe und Papst Leo III. in Paderborn, Philipp von Zabern, Mainz, vol. 2, p. 466, fig. VII.26). On the basis of the above finds a dating of the Jersey fitting to the Carolingian period, c. early to mid-9th century, may be suggested, modelled on strap-fittings from the late Merovingian period.The decorative motifs of the Jersey fitting, comprising a silvered, four-armed whirligig, an eyelet loop and an equal-armed cross in a circle, are of interest, but are rather generic and of little help with dating, or region of production, since they occur widely in both Merovingian and Carolingian metalwork and filigree decoration.""",,Complete,,,Unknown,"Length: 74.98mm, Width: 26.21mm, Thickness: 5.13mm, Weight: 49.0g",01/09/1994,,,,,,,,Intertidal,Cast,Copper alloy,,,Strap fitting,Certain,,,,,401770,,Metal detector,Enamel,,,,,,,Inlaid with enamel

d45422ba-3c9e-4706-937d-a5ddb668ff09,,St. John,Parish,Iron Age 700-51 BCE,Gallo-Roman 51 BCE-451 CE,"An incomplete cast copper alloy Late Iron Age to Gallo-Roman figurine of a female deity or human. The figurine stands facing upwards and slightly to the left, the left arm held high and bent at the elbow, possibly in the action of throwing a spear or holding something high. Her left arm rests down by her side, slightly behind her back. Each arm is missing its respective hand. The top of her head is bulbous, representing either hair pulled back into a ponytail or a helmet. The figurine has a clear surviving face, with stylised depiction of both eyes, nostrils and a mouth. Her cheeks are relatively large and round, curving down to a bear neck. Ears can be seen on either side of her head. At the back of her head rests a clear ponytail or plait that travels down her upper back. The torso of the figurine wears a garment, possibly a peplos, draped over right shoulder travelling down to her knees. Each arm and the left shoulder is bare, the garment hanging diagonally across from her shoulder to her waist leaving revealing her left breast. This loose shoulder of the garment is represented on the front and back of the object by sculpted folds. The garment is cinched at the waist, before curving back outwards and ending approximately at the knees, pleated and gathered into folds. A possible bag or satchel hangs at her left back from her waist, though this may represent the fabric hanging loose from the left shoulder.The surface of the object bears the remains of gilding in recesses, a practice that is noted in other surviving Roman figurines (Duhrum 2012, 2.2.4).Though it would be expected that similar figurines be found in Gaul, no immediately similar figurines are illustrated in Boucher (1976). Instead, this object most closely resembles Roman figurines from the Southbroom Hoard in Southern England, which include similar transverse drapery from the shoulder to the waist (Duhrum 2014, pp.195-221, fig 4, a-b).The identities of Roman and Gallo-Roman figurines are difficult to discern with missing hands and feet, as many diagnostic features are related to objects held by the figure (Duhrum 2014, 2.3.1). The figurine may represent a deity or human. This figurine bears some resemblance to depiction of a maenad or bacchae, female followers of the god Dionysis or Bacchus. The bare breast with one raised arm can be seen in similar maenad depictions, where she may hold a thyrsus staff or snake. Alternatively, the Goddess Diana may be the intended identity of the figurine, who is commonly posed in an active stance with one hand reaching for an arrow at her back, and depicted with her hair in a bun. Revd. Professor Martin Henig, a specialist in Roman figurines, kindly comments that this figurine appears Late Iron Age to Gallo-Roman in date.This object was found relatively close to other Iron Age and Gallo-Roman artefacts, c.0.5km from a Gallo-Roman terret ring (1200347), two Roman dupondii (1200347),  c. 1.45km from another Roman statuette (1200327), and other nearby Iron Age and Roman coins in this parish. This object was also discovered in a field directly beside a spring that feeds into a valley, a common area for Iron Age votive depositional practice.References:Boucher, S.

The object is oval in shape with both ends being rounded and tapered. One end narrows slightly more than the other. In profile it is lentoid in shape and its cross section is a similar lentoid shape. The 'cutting' edge is rounded, from the external edges it tapers gradually until it forms a narrowed but rounded butt. There is no sign of a stop ridge or any form of cast design. It is thickest at the mid-point. The surface of the object is slightly eroded and corroded, the whole surface covered in patina. It is a dark - mid green colour. The edges on all sides of the object are very rounded, through either cast design or corrosion.  A parallel can be found from Ireland, which was the main source of copper during the Chalcolithic period in Atlantic Europe (Harbison 1969).  It has also been suggested that this is an axe blank. Needham (2016, p.38-9) states: ""...there are still a small number of rather amorphous objects  –  oval, sub-triangular, pear-shaped  –  of small size. They can also be rather thin, so little metal is present, and they may have unusual, non-lenticular profiles. Some of these at least do not appear to be badly eroded examples of finished axes; moreover, they are too small to have been destined for working up into standard sized axes. Without more detailed study, it is difficult to attribute a function, but they could have served an ingot function  –  that is, to facilitate the distribution of raw metal... The alternative is that they too are blanks, but despite their vaguely axe-like shape, they were for other implements.  Ref: Needham, S. (2017).

This seal matrix is vesica shaped (oval with pointed ends), 32.69mm long, 20.59mm wide, 3.00mm thick and 6.4g in weight. These seals were used mainly by women, ecclesiastical figures or secular clergy. The obverse of the seal is flat, with a depiction split into an upper and lower register. The upper register depicts ""The Shrine of the Nursing Madonna"" the Virgin Mary nursing Jesus beneath an arch, flanked by two towers with pointed finials. The lower register bears a praying prior or abbot beneath a winged dome, probably meant to represent a  pitched church roof.  The reverse of the matrix, behind the upper pointed end, are the remains of a lug (3.01mm in width, and would have been c 7.01mm in length).  The legend surrounding the device reads: +AVE.MARIA.GRA.PLENA.DMS.TEC €œAve Maria Gratia Plena Dominus Tecum€  This is the ""Hail Mary"", a traditional Catholic prayer in Latin. As this anonymous inscription does not name an individual, it may have been a ready-made seal distributed to various lesser church dignitaries.   Harvey & McGuinness (1996) illustrate a similar seal matrix  dated c.1292: ""Seals of lesser church dignitaries followed a pattern similar to bishops' seals though smaller in size. Thus they are usually a pointed oval, by the late thirteenth century showing a saint - here the Virgin and Child - with suppliant figure below"" (ibid, 74).  Ref: Harvey, P.D.A. & McGuiness, A.

9005f5ac-1146-11ec-8701-0275d4869ef4,,St. Martin,Parish,Unknown,Unknown,"A cast, stamped lozenge shaped silver pendant of unknown date affixed to a silver hammered flat cord by a suspension loop.    Each face of the pendant bears the same stamped decoration of a central solar symbol of a circle surrounded by ten radial curved lines. Directly above, below, left and right of this symbol are stamped circular star-like circular motifs consisting of a central circular pellet surrounded by five other pellets. Between these outer star-symbols are four other stamped indents.   The decoration of each face is not identical, the motifs being spaced unevenly.

The object is dated post-1902, the inscription giving a post- Second Boer War date. The King's Royal Rifle Corps were disbanded and the remainder amalgamated in 1966.  The badge is a Maltese Cross in form, with heavy gilding visible on both sides. The object is flat on the reverse. The top arm of the cross sits a crown decorated with red enamel. Beneath this is the inscription ""CELER ET AUDAX"" (Swift and Bold). Behind this inscription remains a green enamel. A central circle bears the image of a stringed bugle in relief, surrounded by the inscription ""THE KINGS ROYAL RIFLE CORPS"".  Behind this inscription remains a red enamel. The remaining inscription can be difficult to decipher, but looking at surviving non-miniature examples of this cap badge the following can be deciphered on each arm of the cross respectively:  Top: CELER ET AUDAX, Louisberg . Quebec 1769, Peninsula   Delhi, Roleia   Vimiera, Martinique   Talavera, Busaco    Fuentes d' Onor.   Left:  Albuhera   Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz  Salamanca, Ahmed Khel  Kandahar, Vittoria  Pyrenees, Nivelle Nive, Orthes  Toulouse.

Bottom: Chitral , South Africa 1879, South Africa 1899  1902, Afghanistan 1878   80, Defence of Ladysmith, Relief of Ladysmith. 	 It is noted that the smaller inscription cast on this example was unlikely to ever be readable due to its small size and casting quality, and was only meant to mimic the genuine medal. 	 This cap badge appears to be a miniature version, which could be bought by servicemen to wear and display in lieu of wearing their genuine badges and medals.

This seal matrix is conical in shape and has a worn pierced trefoil terminal and a worn collar on the handle. There is no identifiable orientation mark due to the condition of the matrix as it has a rough edge where this mark would have been. The engraved die is somewhat worn resulting in detail of the design and letters in the inscription being hard to decipher. Therefore a cast was taken of the seal matrix which allowed the die's features to become more visible. The central design appears to depict a flower, possibly a rose, with leaves on both sides of the stem. Due to the worn surface of the die it is not clear whether or not the matrix originally had a division between the design and inscription. The inscription remains hard to decipher owing partly to the rough edge of the die and its worn condition, although some letters could be interpreted as 'O' and 'I' and possibly 'V'.

The arms are incomplete, being broken before the elbows. The right arm is forward and upheld with the left arm backwards and pointing downwards. Each leg is missing before the knee, the left slightly lower than the right and standing further forward. The front of the torso bears the heavily abraded remains of a prominent draped garment which appears to meet at the abdomen. The garment is presented as two raised lines split by a groove that curve to the rear of the torso. Heavy abrasion and pitting makes further analysis difficult. The rear of the figurine has a broken area where wings were probably once attached. The object is covered with an intermittent white and brown patina.Three identical Cupid figurines cast of the same mould with surviving heads have been reported on the Portable Antiquity Scheme in Canterbury, Kent (KENT-BB54D0, KENT-223C9B, KENT-206D14). Dr. Emma Durham (2012) states that: ""Although a number of figurines are very similar, suggesting that they may have been made in the same workshop, there is almost no evidence for the reuse of moulds to produce figurines..."". Further, only 3.6% of Roman statuettes are cast in lead, with the vast majority (94.7%) cast in copper alloy (Duhram, 2012). Whilst the find matches a ""Cupid in Flight"" typing seen in Roman examples, only 1 of 32 Cupid figurines is depicted in a tunic, whilst all others are nude (Duhram 2012). These facts imply that the statuette is neo-classical in style and date, matching ornamental figurines produced in the 19th-20th century.References:Durham, E. 2012 Depicting the gods: metal figurines in Roman Britain, Internet Archaeology 31.",,Incomplete,,,,"Length: 60.71mm, Width: 33.3mm, Thickness: 18.64mm, Weight: 69.1g.",25/11/2021,,,,,,,,Cultivated land,Cast,Lead,Metric,Millimetres/grams,Figurine,Certain,,,,,800235,,Metal detector,,,,,,,,

Following these grooves, the barrel continues a short distance before flaring out to a rounded muzzle. Two grooved travel the circumference of this muzzle. The interior of the barrel is circular and smoothbore as opposed to rifled, 10.45mm in diameter. The hammer of the pistol is missing, along with the trigger and rest of the firing mechanism. Heavy iron rust corrosion surrounds the pan. No sideplate remains the side that would have held the sideplate (left if held as if to fire) bears an oval groove where the plate would have sat. The opposite external side has oval decoration  consisting of three grooves. The centre of the oval is decorated with many incised radial grooves. The underneath of the pistol, where the trigger would have sat, has a sub-rectangular area formed of cast grooves. Within this box sits a broken stud and rectangular hole filled with iron corrosion. An integral curved projection travels from the rear of the gun what would have formed the attachment for the stock.These small pistols were easily concealable and often kept for self-defence in the late 18th to early 19th century.  ",,Incomplete,,,,,05/04/2022,,,,,,,,Cultivated land,Cast,Copper alloy,,,Pistol,Certain,,,,,1100408,,Metal detector,,,,,,,Returned to Finder,

Beyond the break the axe widens on each side, ending in a concave but assymetric blade. The surface of the object and blade edge are heavily abraded and pitted. The object bears numerous casting inclusions, one notable inclusion 9.1mm deep  and approximately 5.7mm in diameter  centrally on one corner edge. A second inclusion can be seen off-centre at the transverse break of the object. This possibly contributed to the break due to structural weakness. The heavy pitting on the object may be a result of high-lead content, as it never truly alloys, becoming miniscule globules of lead in the bronze which can create localised galvanic corrosion cells.	It is suggested that it is of late bronze age to early iron in date due to the high lead content, as similar examples of high-lead content ""votive"" axes exist from this period.Dr. Peter Chowne of the University of York comments that this object is possible slag or a very miscast axe, and would have likely been considered casting waste.",,Fragment,,,5 inches,"Length: 31.2mm, Width: 29.8mm, Thickness: 15.3mm, Weight: 44.3g",01/08/2021,,,,,,,"http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/[{u'status': u'uploaded',http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/u'index': 0,http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/u'name': u'0900428 - axe head fragment.jpg',http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/0900428_-_axe_head_fragment.jpg',http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/u'lastModified': 1633959834355,http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/4eeaac73-8055-40c2-8fc3-b1cfe9eebcc7',http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/u'file_id': u'155717bc-3182-11ec-8701-0275d4869ef4',http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/u'accepted': True,http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/jpeg',http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/u'size': 6131748}]",Cultivated land,Cast,Copper alloy,Metric,Millimetres/grams,Axehead,Possibly,,,,,900428,,Metal detector,Lead,,,,,,,

Long tongues of bronze projecting down neck to front and back, relieved steeply upwards to flat shoulders at sides.Dimensions: 18mm front to back, 16mm wide, 29mm high. Rear tongue at neck is 9mm long with 3mm wide flats at shoulders; front tongue broken off half-way down. Internal diameter is 7. 3mm, narrowing to 4. 8mm at top for c. 4mm, splaying out for last 1mm to 6. 5mm diameter at crown of head. Interior of hole is irregular, showing that it was cast rather than drilled, probably around a hand-modelled clay core which was broke out after casting. The head is mostly shaped in a Roman style with correctly proportioned elongated face, apparently clean-shaven and oval when viewed from above. It appears to be copying the form of a Roman emperor, wearing a laurel wreath over short hair, tied with a loop at the nape of the neck. This is where the classical similarities end however, as the laurel leaves face backwards, are of odd sizes, and there are traces above and below the wreath of elaborately sweptback hair. A possible torc is worn at the neck, apparently resting on the shoulders and falling to front and rear. The ears are prominent and kidney-shaped, while the over-large eyes are decidedly lentoid, swept back towards the ears in Celtic fashion. The face is very worn, so the nose is almost invisible, but appears to form a long triangular shape. The mouth is a straight line with circular indents at its extremities. Comparison with other examples from Britain and France show that this was the pommel of a full-length late Iron Age sword, probably of La Tene III type, dating to the mid- | late first century BC. An example found in a 264 warrior grave at North Grimston, Lincolnshire (Plate 6) now in Hull Museum shows how the head would have been mounted, in the saddle between the two raised arms of a bronze hilt which would have had two similar legs at the bottom functioning as a guard. The tang of the sword passed through a hole which ran the full length of the cast bronze hilt and through the pommel, the soft iron tip of the tang being carefully hammered to spread it into the countersunk hole at the crown of the pommel, preventing the components from coming apart in battle. In addition to the North Grimston sword, an extremely fine Gaulish example, again with a head bearing mixed Celtic and Roman features is held in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Swords with anthropoid hilts are characteristic of Celtic Europe in the first century BC, with fifty or so surviving from this period. They were often included in richly-fitted graves, suggesting that they were the valued property of aristocratic warriors. The tradition of creating anthropoid hilts of this form was long lived and had its origins in the middle Iron Age of Continental Europe with known examples from France, Germany, Czechoslovakia and as far West as Ballyshannon Bay in County Donegal, Ireland. These are dated to the second and first centuries BC and many are cast in one piece. The casting of hilts in two pieces as in the case of the Jersey example seems to be a development of the mid-first century BC. This is a very exciting find for Jersey, no other late Iron Age swords or parts of them having been identified to date (although Guernsey has several from the Middle Iron Age). A find of a late second century BC Roman silver denarius in the same field is presumably  significant, and further research into the site is planned by the author and the finder.",,Incomplete,,,,Dimensions: 29.5mm x 18mm x 11mm Weight: 22.73g,13/06/2017,,,,,,,"http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/[{u'status': u'uploaded',http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/u'index': 0,http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/u'name': u'0900431 - Iron age pommel.JPG',http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/0900431_-_Iron_age_pommel.JPG',http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/u'lastModified': 1634909435457,http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/u'height': 394,http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/7826e652-2ad0-47bd-90b9-ab81342b3d1d',http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/u'width': 1244,http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/u'file_id': u'453504ba-333c-11ec-8701-0275d4869ef4',http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/u'accepted': True,http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/jpeg',http://jerseyv6-arches-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/u'size': 64837}]",Cultivated land,Cast,Copper alloy,Metric,Millimetres/grams,Sword pommel,Certain,,,,,900431,,Metal detector,,,,,,,,

Most of the mauls appear slightly different in form, the groove being pecked widthways around the pebble instead of lengthways. Further, the groove of the object is generally shallower than British examples, such as this sandstone example find GAT-09E9E4 recorded on the Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS).

There may be slight evidence of flanged on either side with a slight concave towards the centre, though heavy erosion makes this uncertain. There is a clean break removing the butt of the object. The profile of the axe is lenticular.The surface is heavily pitted with the brownish-green patina of copper-alloy.The shape of the object ""heel"" bears resemblance to Normandy Type axes of the middle bronze age, though the lack of diagnostic features makes it impossible to identify for certain (Briard, J; 1976).This object's form is similar to full-sized, solid flat axes, resembling a smaller version of the earliest and simplest solid cast copper alloy axe-heads with tapering sides and rounded butts. It is uncertain whether it is a miniature axe or a chisel intended for fine working or was intended as a votive object; it is larger than other miniature axes (eg. Portable Antiquities Scheme: HAMP-B3BE22, HAMP-657353) which have been proposed to have a votive function (Robinson, P; 1995).Miniature flat axes such as this tend to fit in the chronology at the very end of the early Bronze Age when developed axes are starting out. It is likely that this example is dated to the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II-III), of metalworking tradition phase IV-V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2050 - 1700 CAL. BC.

In the centre of the star is the letter 'I' but some have interpreted this as a chalice because of the pronounced serifs. Between the points of the star are semi-circles with varying diameters. The two 'upper' points contain florets, with small dots in the 'lower' points. There is also light hatching behind the 'I' and a slightly more prominent crosshatch across the majority of the base. The base's shape is a rectangle on top of an inverted trapezium. There is also a crescent shape at a similar depth to the semi-circles which links the top to the base. The reverse consists of two curves. The curve behind the top of the object has a small hole or suspension loop. This shape seems to be unusual but perhaps was used for particularly thick material as it would have been attached to a cap or clothing. The object is somewhat worn, more so in some places, and is grey in colour with orange discoloration in areas, particularly in the crevices. It has an even and stable copper corrosion product surface.  John McCormack (2020) has researched this object and highlights several aspects of the object including that the object may have had an additional piece at the top, possibly a filament as well as suggesting that the 'I' stands for 'Jhesu'. This is based on information from 'Symboles' published by Zodiacque, page 56, which explains that a six-pointed star/the Star of David was used to denote power and therefore Christ and his descent from the kings of Israel, David and Solomon.  McCormack's (2020) research also compared the object to seal matrices: IOW-6A58A8 (Portable Antiquities Scheme Database) and M16-0224 and M16-0311 (Hammond 2014, 693, 709). As these include the 'I' as well as a floret similar to the angle of the badge which McCormack (2020) suggests may refer to the Virgin Mary. Another object which McCormack (2020) highlights is a quern stone discovered in Castel, Guernsey which also reflects the 'I' and may be of a similar date to the badge. McCormack (2020) has tentatively dated the stone as circa late 15th-early 16th century.  The object is significant due to the findspot's proximity to the important local site, La Hougue Bie, as well as the likelihood of its uniqueness. McCormack (2020) suggests that the badge may have been owned by Dean Mabon, the Dean of Jersey and a rector of St Martin's Parish. Mabon undertook a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and after his return reconstructed the eastern part of La Hougue Bie's chapel to incorporate a crypt in 1520. The site became a local centre of pilgrimage. McCormack (2020) also suggests that he may have brought the badge back from the Holy Land or Mabon may have created the badge himself to sell to pilgrims but due to the possibility of the object being unique believes this is unlikely.   Further research is currently being undertaken and therefore this record will be updated in due course to reflect other interpretations.

It is a dense, grey dolerite with purple streaks forming a looping organic pattern in halos around both flat faces and on the broader long edge. All narrow edges on the pebble have some degree of battering, parts of which are also fringed with purple. There is some slight chipping on either side of the long narrow edge that suggests it has been used as a hammer stone. Both flat faces have additionally been rubbed very smooth, against another hard surface. The surfaces of both flat faces have been the targets of heavy anvil activity resulting in two oval pits c. 20cm x 3.4cm on one face, and a c.2 x 6cm pit on the other face. This singular pit is an elongated groove with a deeper pit at one end coinciding with the purple halo. In several places, notably on its long broad edge and around the pits in the flat faces there are linear scars. This suggests the stone has been used as an anvil in the making of flint blades. A very similar multi-purpose stone tool, dated to the early Neolithic period, was found accompanied by flint debitage at Halkett Place in St Helier in the early 1920s and is described by Sinel (1923, Prehistoric Times and Men of the Channel Islands, p.79) as follows; 'A flat diorite pebble, about 10 inches in length, 4 inches wide at its broadest end, and tapering to a point at the other. This seems to have served as an ordinary chopper, for its thinnest edge bears unmistakeable evidence of some such use.

At the end of each cross arm sits a roughly trapezoidal shape with curved edge facing inwards to the cross terminals. All but one of these raised settings have lost its glass enamel. These trapezoidal shapes make up the central pieces of larger crescent shaped lines, bordered on either side by pieces of irregular shaped quartz crystals before ending in irregular shaped blue enamel fragments. Four of the circular quartz crystals and four of the blue enamel fragments show the remains of drilled holes, possibly as a means to connect or pin the fragment to the face of the brooch.

The object bears three further inlays, each c.2.80mm diameter, set around the central inlay in a triangular pattern which also likely held stones or coloured glass.  The central inlay is surrounded by six curvilinear openwork bars c.2mm thick that interlace to create rounded flower-petal like decoration. These bars are decorated with dots.

Dr. Emma Durham (2012) states that: ""Although a number of figurines are very similar, suggesting that they may have been made in the same workshop, there is almost no evidence for the reuse of moulds to produce figurines..."". Further, only 3.6% of Roman statuettes are cast in lead, with the vast majority (94.7%) cast in copper alloy (Duhram, 2012). Whilst the find matches a ""Cupid in Flight"" typing seen in Roman examples, only 1 of 32 Cupid figurines is depicted in a tunic, whilst all others are nude (Duhram 2012).

There may be slight evidence of flanged on either side with a slight concave towards the centre, though heavy erosion makes this uncertain. There is a clean break removing the butt of the object. The profile of the axe is lenticular.The surface is heavily pitted with the brownish-green patina of copper-alloy.The shape of the object ""heel"" bears resemblance to Normandy Type axes of the middle bronze age, though the lack of diagnostic features makes it impossible to identify for certain (Briard, J; 1976).This object's form is similar to full-sized, solid flat axes, resembling a smaller version of the earliest and simplest solid cast copper alloy axe-heads with tapering sides and rounded butts. It is uncertain whether it is a miniature axe or a chisel intended for fine working or was intended as a votive object; it is larger than other miniature axes (eg. Portable Antiquities Scheme: HAMP-B3BE22, HAMP-657353) which have been proposed to have a votive function (Robinson, P; 1995).Miniature flat axes such as this tend to fit in the chronology at the very end of the early Bronze Age when developed axes are starting out. It is likely that this example is dated to the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II-III), of metalworking tradition phase IV-V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2050 - 1700 CAL. BC. Axes of this size and form are difficult to parallel, Schmidt & Burgess (1981) catalogue a number of small developed flat axes as Variant Swinton (p 67-8, nos. 375-380) but all examples are between 87mm and 92mm in length.

016acef1-cb6f-4621-9794-3847aa678346,,,,Iron Age 700-51 BCE,Iron Age 700-51 BCE,"Incomplete cast bronze figurine of Iron Age date, with upper half and legs found separately. This object is identified and discussed in Martin Henig and Mark Wood (1990), who describe the object as following:""The upper part of a cast bronze of a nude male figure (Plate l), which X-ray fluorescence analysis has shown to have been made of a leaded tin bronze alloy. It is covered with a green patination, and has suffered more seriously from corrosion in places. The figure is broken away at the waist, immediately below the navel, the shallow boring of which may have provided a point of weakness. The body is of slight build and reasonably well modelled at least on the front, but the back is rough. The right arm is bent at the elbow but as the hand is missing there is no indication of any attribute. The navel and nipples are indicated by shallow borings (the nipple on the left of the body having been lost through corrosion). In relation to the body, the pear-shaped head is massive. It is turned to the left (i.e. the viewer’s right). The physiognomy is dominated by large eyes with heavy brows, the pupil of the right eye is bored and the slit mouth is emphasised by heavy lips. As far as can be seen, the nose is flat and triangular, but wear and corrosion have made detail indistinct. Ears are barely indicated by depressions at the sides of the head. The crown is flattened and slopes backwards. The surface here is badly corroded. Dimensions: Surviving height 38 mm; greatest width 28 mm; depth of body 6 mm; depth of head (from the chin to the crown of the head) 12 mm. While the tradition of naturalistic bronzecasting is a Mediterranean one, which only becomes widespread in north-westem Europe with the coming of the Roman Empire, this bronze is in no way related to Roman bronzes of the Imperial period, although it is not unlike some clearly native figurines made in the North of Italy from the fourth to the second century BC (Franzoni 1980, 121-158, nos 100-137). It seems that these were imported across the Alps and up the RhBne valley and copied in Gaul (Boucher 1976, 13-43); especially close is the figure from Pointe du Raz in Western Brittany (ibid. 35, fig. 35). The prototype was probably an Italic Hercules (Franzoni, op. cit.), but it is not known what such a bronze might have symbolised in Gaul. It is worth mentioning that early bronzes are known from Britain. Actual Italic bronzes are recorded from Mount Batten, Plymouth (Cunliffe 1988, 70-72, nos 128, 129). Two very fine female figurines of Iron Age date come from Aust-by-Severn (Cunliffe 1978, 155, and plate 22b, but not Iberian as stated); and from Henley Wood (Wilson 1970,296 and plate XXXVd) . Male figures are recorded from Dartmoor (Christie’s Antiquities Sale Catalogue, 16 December 1982,8, lot 24), and from Maiden Castle (in the Dorset County Museum, Dorchester) . All of these bronzes are from sites in south-western Britain."". Post-publication, the legs of this figurine were found, and the figurine now resides in the Jersey Heritage collection.References: Henig, M. and Wood, M.

Flanges emerge from the butt of the axe on each face, running almost its entire length save for the cutting edge itself. These flanges measure at a depth of c.10.04mm and c.6.42mm at the thickest point. The butt is uneven and flared, though flat, showing evidence of extensive hammering to its rear. the cutting edge of the blade is still very sharp and complete, except for two chips. Evidence of hammering and sharpening is visible at its edge.The axe is roughly lozenge shaped in profile, with faint but visible casting seams on each side, which appear to have been carefully filed. The axe is undecorated.The surface of the object is slightly abraded and almost entirely unpatinated due to its intertidal findspot, save for some recessed areas. The object is otherwise in very good condition, with clear unrolled edges, and likely sat on a deep surface layer below the sand. The axe most closely resembles those of Medoc type II (or 'medium type'), named after those found in Médoc in Southern France. This type is exemplified by its length, measuring from 140 to 160mm, and flange depth measuring 8mm to 11mm. The axehead does bear some similarity to Atlantic type axeheads, with its flaring cutting edge, but is significantly larger than axes of this type. Briard and Verron (1976, pp.51-52) highlight overlap between Medoc type axes and other forms, such as Atlantic types. This axe may represent some Medoc-Atlantic cross influence.Notes:Though the findspot of the axe was intertidal, it is found squarely in-line with the course of a valley and stream. The land and stream may have continued over the ancient land-surface of the time, and imply a purposeful deposition within a stream or its mouth, a common feature for Bronze Age Finds. References:Briard, J. and Verron, G. 1976.

Her left arm rests down by her side, slightly behind her back. Each arm is missing its respective hand. The top of her head is bulbous, representing either hair pulled back into a ponytail or a helmet. The figurine has a clear surviving face, with stylised depiction of both eyes, nostrils and a mouth. Her cheeks are relatively large and round, curving down to a bear neck. Ears can be seen on either side of her head. At the back of her head rests a clear ponytail or plait that travels down her upper back. The torso of the figurine wears a garment, possibly a peplos, draped over right shoulder travelling down to her knees. Each arm and the left shoulder is bare, the garment hanging diagonally across from her shoulder to her waist leaving revealing her left breast. This loose shoulder of the garment is represented on the front and back of the object by sculpted folds. The garment is cinched at the waist, before curving back outwards and ending approximately at the knees, pleated and gathered into folds. A possible bag or satchel hangs at her left back from her waist, though this may represent the fabric hanging loose from the left shoulder.The surface of the object bears the remains of gilding in recesses, a practice that is noted in other surviving Roman figurines (Duhrum 2012, 2.2.4).Though it would be expected that similar figurines be found in Gaul, no immediately similar figurines are illustrated in Boucher (1976). Instead, this object most closely resembles Roman figurines from the Southbroom Hoard in Southern England, which include similar transverse drapery from the shoulder to the waist (Duhrum 2014, pp.195-221, fig 4, a-b).The identities of Roman and Gallo-Roman figurines are difficult to discern with missing hands and feet, as many diagnostic features are related to objects held by the figure (Duhrum 2014, 2.3.1). The figurine may represent a deity or human. This figurine bears some resemblance to depiction of a maenad or bacchae, female followers of the god Dionysis or Bacchus. The bare breast with one raised arm can be seen in similar maenad depictions, where she may hold a thyrsus staff or snake. Alternatively, the Goddess Diana may be the intended identity of the figurine, who is commonly posed in an active stance with one hand reaching for an arrow at her back, and depicted with her hair in a bun. Revd. Professor Martin Henig, a specialist in Roman figurines, kindly comments that this figurine does appear Late Iron Age to Gallo-Roman in date.This object was found relatively close to other Iron Age and Gallo-Roman artefacts,c.0.5km from a Gallo-Roman terret ring (1200347), two Roman dupondii (1200347),  c. 1.45 from another Roman statuette (1200327), and other nearby Iron Age and Roman coins in this parish.

A shallow groove has been pecked around the circumference of the object lengthways at its middle point.The pebble is of igneous local granite, pinkish-grey in colour, with quartz crystalline inclusions. The pebble is attractive and smooth. The groove has been pecked on the surface of the rock to form a shallow groove approximately 1.9mm deep and varying in width from  c.9mm to c.7.5mm. This groove may have been to retain of a withy to be attached to a haft. Each face of the hammer bears minor evidence of wear, including pecking and possible abrasion. Similar grooved pebbles identified as Bronze Age mining mauls or hammers have been recorded in Britain (Timberlake & Craddock, 2013). Most of the mauls appear slightly different in form, the groove being pecked widthways around the pebble instead of lengthways. Further, the groove of the object is generally shallower than British examples, such as this sandstone example find GAT-09E9E4 recorded on the Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS). This may be explained by the extremely hard nature of local granite over softer stones like sandstone, and implies that this object would have taken a large amount of effort to create.No currently known ore mining sites exist on the island, other than small amounts of zinc and silver lead which were not mined in the Bronze Age.

The mount has a rough surface and a brown and green patina with some red spots.		This object is likely a mount, similar to an example in Read (2001, pp. 33, 41). Other mounts of similar tri-lobed design are found on the Portable Antiquity Scheme (LVPL-099CF7, SUR-BA5695, SUR-A846CD, SUR-6E3814).		References:Read, B.

The two larger fragments have the same pale green surface patina, while the smaller fragment appears to have a break matching the median piece, suggesting that all three came from the same weapon.  The largest piece (167a) has two sets of seven finely engraved lines, running parallel to each other down both adjoining faces on either side of the blade, converging to a point on the central rib 29mm down the blade from its upper end.  Each of these lines is about 003mm wide and about 0.7mm apart, forming bands 4.6mm wide, which are very slightly convex over their length.  The larger pieces both have gas bubbles in their broken faces; these are plough-battered, with pale green bronze disease, so were broken in antiquity.Dirks or short swords of Treboul type (named after the place in Brittany where weapons with this type of decoration were first identified), with the handle being riveted to the blade just above its unusually broad head, were manufactured in Armorica (present-day Brittany and Western Normandy) between c.1500-1200 BC.A hilt fragment of a dirk or short sword with similar decoration to 167a (SJFR166) was found in Field T945, but Middle Bronze Age artefacts are uncommon in Jersey and these are the only finds of engraved Treboul type swords known from the island.",,Fragment,,,,,25/01/2018,,,,,,,,Cultivated land,Cast,Copper alloy,,,Sword,Certain,,,,,1100415,,Metal detector,,,,,,,,

The axehead is irregular and asymmetrical in plan, with long, slightly curving sides leading to an asymmetric abraded edge. The axehead is very worn, with a large chip on a face above the butt, and a number of large chips on a corner of the butt. The edge of the axe is also chipped on one corner. Each face bears an uneven bevel, sloping down to a highly polished surface to its edge. The surface before this highly polished edge, towards the butt, is less polished and retains lengthways striations where it has been ground during manufacture. The sides of the axehead are relatively flat and ground, and the butt of the axehead is mostly flat. The axehead shows some signs of reworking on its edge, implying use as a tool. The axehead is a pointed oval in section.The flint is mid-grey in colour.This axehead is said to have been found with another axehead, which was subsequently lost by the finder.This axehead was previously published in the Societe Jersiaise Annual Bulletin (2014, p. 259). References:Waterhouse, R.
