Absolute Archaeology recommended that an archaeological evaluation to carried out in areas of archaeological potential, particularly focusing on the area near Keppel Tower. A written scheme of investigation documented the methodology of archaeological work including an archaeological evaluation consisting of six trenches and an archaeological building recording for Keppel Tower and a 19th century extension.  </p>

<p>Four trenches were excavated in the area to the South of Keppel Tower and to the West of Elizabeth Cottage for the archaeological evaluation.

The evaluation trenches resulted in a considerable amount of archaeological survival being discovered and the recorded deposits included occupation layers in between wind blow sand deposits and structural remains. The majority of the archaeological deposits were dated to Early Medieval/Medieval. Therefore there would be a high impact on the archaeology due to the redevelopment of the site ,,,15-17 ,400302.1, ,,,Government of Jersey,HE0302,

One excavation trench was opened in the northeast of the site. This trench produced two archaeological features - a linear feature and rubbish pit. The pit was oval in plan and contained pottery fragments dating 8th-10th centuries. A well structure was also excavated and was constructed with rounded and angular granite fragments. An early-wall foundation was also recorded - a semi-circular construction of rounded granite fragments. Sealing the structures was a dark possible occupation layer, dated to 13th century based on the pottery uncovered. A layer of windblown sands below the floor slab dated to 13th-14th century again due to the pottery found. ",13/07/2007,,15-17 ,400302.2,09/07/2007,,,Government of Jersey,HE0302,

This site in Old Street/31 The Parade (0401130 and 0401133) was excavated 4 times between 1973 and 1986 due to being opened and closed as the site was used as a car park. Part of the area excavated were numbers 13 and 13a Old Street which were 18th century gardens of cottages. One uncovered feature was a mid-13th century small domestic aisled hall which was of longhouse form and built on sand. The walls were made of clay-bonded granite and the floor was sealed by a layer of clay. Coins dating to the early 13th century were found in the floor layer and yard. Much of the stone was robbed once it fell into disuse. The western end of the house was destroyed by deep cesspits whilst the eastern wall and yard were lost due to cultivation. This part of the house remained intact and the southern yard survived undisturbed. The wall was 0.6m thick and in places was at a height of three courses. The stone came from the Fort Regent area and was sea worn. There was no evidence that the stone had been quarried. Two rubbish tips or shallow areas of rubbish concentrations were found in the yard. One contained charcoal dust, a coin, shall sherds of pottery, unburnt bone and shell. These contents are consistent with sweepings from the house floor. The other contained a large collection of pottery sherds. The drip gully suggests that the house would have been thatched. A hearth was found and the base was lined with stones and sunken below floor level. The floor in this area had a quantity of food debris, predominantly limpet shells stacked in piles and two cooking pot bases were imbedded in the surrounding floor. Other finds included metal objects such as nails, a section of a bone-handled knife, a small piece of bronze strip decoration, the remains of a key, a coin, a strand of wool and tiny fragments of pottery.

<p> Three trenches were excavated in 1976 at 27-29 Broad Street (0401412, 0401413, 0401414). These trenches uncovered the Iron Age shoreline and a small stone structure built against a storm beach. Clay was used for a series of floors and to bond the walls. From the stone set hearth and pot-hole came early La Tene pottery and grains of carbonised '5 row' barley. The habitation had been partly washed out by the sea and rebuilt more than once making it likely that it was seasonal occupied, as well as the presence of sand between the occupation layers. There are two carbon 14 dates, both of 400-300BC. </p>

<p>The Iron Age habitation site was primarily on the demolished site of 29 Broad Street. There were also traces of medieval and later material were found in the upper levels of the overburden. The work was restricted by a small space, only a section of the building was excavated but was well recorded. However, the size of space did impact the understanding of the building's plan but also by the 18th century well and a vast modern pit. The width of the building, wall to wall, was not greater than 2.4m.  The length is unknown as the area beyond the hearth remained unexcavated but it was in excess of 3m. The remains of the back wall which lay against a bank of sand ran straight so that is is likely that the building took the general form of an oval or oblong. In one place the front or seaward wall stood at a height of 0.5,. Originally this was up to 0.4m wide and composed of medium sized beach stones set in clay. A flat, stone hearth with raised sides lay set in the earliest floor and in the centre were a number of small, even sized stones affected by heating which may have been used for 'pot boiling'. This was eventually covered by a second clay floor and at least one of the walls was rebuilt.  </p>

<p>Some finds discovered include grain retrieved from the floor and other food debris. The pottery found was given a provisional date of 3rd to 1st century BC due to the style and decoration.

The Desk-Based Assessment highlighted a strong presence of medieval and prehistoric archaeology in the study area. The Project Design proposed 3 test pits. The Archaeological Test Pit Evaluation included the 3 test pits proposed in the Project Design. Absolute Archaeology found that the site was within a disused 18th-19th century aggregates quarry and that evidence from Test Pit 2 supported the construction of the house as finds included late 18th - early 19th century ceramics sealed within backfill. They concluded that there was a very low potential for preservation of archaeology across the site. ",30/11/2010,,Clos du Menage,900244,12/07/2009,,,Government of Jersey,OU0244,

The horizon is buried by wind-blown sand and the buried soil is indicative of local environmental change. Finds were uncovered by hand sieving and wet sieving environmental samples. The finds include Late Neolithic/Bronze Age pottery, worked flint of Bronze Age date, burnt flint and fired clay. These suggest settlement activity of this date. The evaluation resulted in the recommendation of a mitigation strategy to address the remaining archaeological potential including targeted sampling of geoarchaeological and palaeo-environmental remains and an investigation in advance of extraction to target archaeological remains and stratified deposits of prehistoric settlement, funerary or ceremonial activity which may become exposed when the overburden is removed.

Dense concentrations of lithics in slope deposits have been traced over 50m upslope from where the original surface material was discovered; across two fields from Field S800 into Field S756. In 2014 the focus moved wholly to field 756 where investigations revealed primary context archaeology associated with land-surfaces, features and new types of finds comprising faunal remains and the engraved schist fragments. The nature of the stone artefacts suggests a final Magdalenian date, and this is supported by OSL dates. The important archaeological material lies within reach of the plough and could be impacted upon by even minor groundworks or tree planting. Only limited parts of the body of sediment preserving the archaeology have been investigated.",2018,,Les Varines,1100318,2010,,,Government of Jersey,SA0318,

Archaeological watching brief - Martin on behalf of Sara Marsh Architects. (09.10.2012).  Absolute Archaeology LLP was commissioned by Sara Marsh Architects to undertake a watching brief which was recommended as part of the desk-based assessment to mitigate the impact on potential archaeology associated with the creation of a sand school in field T651.   The results of the watching brief and subsequent excavation demonstrated previously unrecognised prehistoric and medieval activity associated with the landscape around the earthwork/promontory fort. It has shown the potential for significant earth disturbance to have occurred in the Final Neolithic and that this reduction of land may have resulted in the creation of the neighbouring rampart of the fort. Followed immediately by the installation/reinstatement of a bank and ditch boundary mistaken as a post-medieval field boundary and may have acted as an animal enclosure.
