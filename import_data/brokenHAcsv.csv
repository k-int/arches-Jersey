The pipe, which would have been inserted into the barrel, has broken off. The spout is also broken part way along its length, below a small squared projection, on which a container could be hung. The tap handle is missing, which makes exact dating difficult.",,,,"<p>A rare survival of an area of early strip cultivation (ridge-and-furrow) of likely medieval age.</p><p>The 2020 LiDAR imagery shows a clearly defined area of strip cultivation (ridge-and-furrow) in the northern half of field S252. The 1795 Richmond map shows this as two smaller fields - hence the differential survival between the fields. This is a rare survival inland, away from the less intensively farmed coastal areas, and is most likely a fragment of a much wider medieval field system that has been enclosed by later field boundaries.  The field has remained uncultivated for many years and is used as pasture for cattle grazing rather than being subject to modern ploughing. The LiDAR shows the ridge-and-furrow preserved beneath the modern landscape. The practice of ploughing individual strips to form patterns of ridges flanked by furrows is the most characteristic feature of surviving medieval open-field systems. Examples can take the form of a 'S' or shallow curving C when viewed in plan - dictated by the movement of the ox-teams drawing the plough. The ploughing pattern in field S252 is diagonal to the later field boundaries; the individual ridges measuring around 10 metres in width.</p>",,Post Medieval 1540-1901 CE,1100396,,,,,Field Number,,,,,,,,,GEOMETRYCOLLECTION (POINT (-2.06925 49.208498)),,,Field System S252 S252,,
