These trenches were on the site of Hampshire garden cottages. The environment was dune sand over layered peat and sand. The only evidence that  there was habitation was related to the demolished cottages, dating from the early 19th century. The finds were a wide range of dates within the 19th century as well as a few sherds of 18th century pottery which may have come from a house nearby marked on a 1737 map.
